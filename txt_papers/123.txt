ABSTRACT—Most

models assume that response time (RT)
comprises the time required for successive processing
stages, but they disagree about whether information is
transmitted continuously or discretely between stages. We
tested these alternative hypotheses by measuring when
movement-related activity began in the frontal eye ﬁeld
(FEF) of macaque monkeys performing visual search.
Previous work showed that RT was longer when visual
neurons in FEF took longer to select the target, a ﬁnding
consistent with prolonged perceptual processing during
less efﬁcient search. We now report that the buildup of
saccadic movement-related activity in FEF is delayed in
inefﬁcient visual search. Variability in the delay of movement-related activity accounted for the difference in RT
between search conditions and for the variability of RT
within conditions. These ﬁndings provide neurophysiological support for the hypothesis that information is transmitted discretely between perceptual and response stages of
processing during visual search.
Since response time (RT) was ﬁrst measured, it has been hypothesized to be a composite of the times taken to complete a
series of different computations at different processing stages
(Donders, 1868/1969; Meyer, Osman, Irwin, & Yantis, 1988).
This premise has been substantiated by demonstrations that
different manipulations inﬂuence distinct subprocesses (Sternberg, 1969, 2001). However, the stage conception of RT remains

controversial (e.g., Luce, 1986). One point of disagreement
concerns how information ﬂows between processing stages (see
Fig. 1a). According to discrete-ﬂow models, a later stage (e.g.,
response selection) cannot begin until a prior stage (e.g., perception) is completed. According to continuous-ﬂow models, a
subsequent stage can begin before a prior stage has completed
processing.
Predictions of discrete- and continuous-ﬂow models have
been examined using behavioral (e.g., Eriksen & Schultz, 1979;
Pashler, 1984), modeling (McClelland, 1979), and electrophysiological (e.g., Gratton, Coles, Sirevaag, Eriksen, & Donchin, 1988; Miller & Hackley, 1992; Osman, Bashore, Coles,
Donchin, & Meyer, 1992) methods. Although continuous-ﬂow
models are favored by some researchers, many of the ﬁndings
consistent with such models can be accounted for by a discreteﬂow model that asynchronously transmits separate features (like
color and shape) from the perceptual stage to the responsepreparation stage (Miller, 1982, 1988; Roberts & Sternberg,
1993). A critical problem researchers face in evaluating these
hypotheses is how to reliably measure the termination of one
stage and the beginning of a subsequent stage with sufﬁcient
temporal resolution among populations of neurons that plausibly
instantiate the required functions (e.g., Gratton et al., 1988;
Miller & Hackley, 1992; Osman et al., 1992).
Neurophysiological data from sensorimotor structures can
distinguish between these models with unprecedented resolution because different subpopulations of neurons appear to
perform perceptual processing and response preparation (for a
review, see Schall, 2004). One population of neurons in the
frontal eye ﬁeld (FEF), posterior parietal cortex, and superior
colliculus discriminates target objects in visual search arrays
(e.g., McPeek & Keller, 2002; Schall & Hanes, 1993; Thomas &

Fig. 1. Predictions of discrete versus continuous ﬂow. The illustration in (a) shows the relative timing of perceptual processing and response
preparation in efﬁcient search (a two-object array) and inefﬁcient search (an eight-object array). According to discrete-ﬂow models, response
preparation does not begin until perceptual processing is ﬁnished, and therefore is delayed in inefﬁcient search. According to continuous-ﬂow
models, response preparation can begin gradually as soon as any perceptual information is available, and therefore begins at the same time in
efﬁcient and inefﬁcient search, but proceeds more gradually in inefﬁcient search. Thus, the dashed line indicates when response preparation
begins in both conditions, and the diagonal lines indicate differences in the rate of this preparation. RT 5 response time. The top two graphs in (b)
show the response of a visual neuron in the frontal eye ﬁeld when the search target (solid line) or distractor (dotted line) appears in the neuron’s
receptive ﬁeld (RF); the upper graph illustrates the pattern of activation on trials with short RTs, and the lower graph illustrates the pattern of
activation on trials with long RTs. The thick dashed vertical line indicates when the visual neuron discriminated the target from a distractor when
search was easy, and the thin dashed vertical line indicates when the visual cell selected the target in the hard search trials. The bottom graph in
(b) illustrates hypothesized patterns of activity of movement-related neurons in the frontal eye ﬁeld. Saccades are initiated when the activity
reaches a threshold (horizontal gray line). The solid black line indicates movement-related activity in the case of efﬁcient search. When RTs are
longer and search is more inefﬁcient, the continuous-ﬂow hypothesis predicts that movement-related activity begins as soon as any information
about target location is available (dashed gray line), whereas the discrete-ﬂow hypothesis predicts that movement-related activity begins only after
the target is selected by visual neurons (solid gray line). The illustrations in (c) are examples of the search arrays used in (from left to right) the
color and motion feature-search tasks and the spatial-conﬁguration search task. Examples of displays in the efﬁcient-search condition are in the
top row, and examples of displays in the inefﬁcient-search condition are shown in the bottom row. In (c), the size of the arrows represents motion
coherence, with smaller arrows indicating lower motion coherence. An example of the intermediate set size (4) is not shown.

Discrete Flow During Visual Search

Paré, 2007). These neurons produce an initially indiscriminant
volley of activity that subsequently evolves to signal that the
target or a distractor is in their receptive ﬁelds (see Fig. 1b).
These neurons distinguish the target from distractors at a later
time when search RT is longer because of greater similarity of
the target and distractors but not when RT is longer because of
greater response competition (Sato, Murthy, Thompson, & Schall,
2001; Thompson, Hanes, Bichot, & Schall, 1996). Therefore, the
time at which these neurons signal target location plausibly
marks the conclusion of perceptual analysis.
A different population of neurons in FEF and superior colliculus instantiates response preparation; the activity of a neuron in this population increases gradually before a saccade into
the neuron’s movement ﬁeld, and a saccade is initiated when the
discharge rate reaches a threshold (see Fig. 1b: Hanes & Schall,
1996). If saccades are prepared but not executed, the movement-related activity is modulated in a manner sufﬁcient to
control gaze, whereas the activity of visual neurons does not
determine whether and when a saccade will be made (Hanes,
Patterson, & Schall, 1998). Thus, models of information ﬂow can
be tested by measuring the duration of perceptual processing
through the activity of visual neurons and by measuring the
beginning and duration of response preparation through
the activity of movement-related neurons (Schall, 2004; see
Fig. 1b).
We evaluated competing information-transmission hypotheses by measuring the beginning of movement-related activity in
the FEF of macaques performing visual search. The difﬁculty of
perceptual processing was varied by manipulating the visual
similarity among the search stimuli (in color space or motion
coherence) or the number of distractors in the search array (see
Fig. 1c). These stimulus manipulations provide large variability in RT between conditions (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989;
Wolfe, 1998). Figure 1b illustrates how the pattern of activity of
movement-related neurons can distinguish between continuous
and discrete ﬂow. The continuous-ﬂow hypothesis predicts that
movement-related activity begins as soon as any information
about target location is available, so the rate of growth to the
trigger threshold should be more gradual in inefﬁcient than in
efﬁcient search. The discrete-ﬂow hypothesis predicts that
movement-related activity begins only after the target is selected by visual neurons, and so should be systematically delayed during inefﬁcient relative to efﬁcient search (see the large
difference in onset of activity between the black and gray solid
lines in the bottom graph of Fig. 1b).

METHOD

Four macaque monkeys (Macaca radiata and Macaca mulatta)
participated in color and motion feature-search tasks, and a 5th
participated in a search task in which the target was deﬁned by
the spatial conﬁguration of line segments (rotated T among ro-

130

tated Ls, and vice versa). All procedures were approved by the
Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Stimuli and Procedures
The surgical and training procedures we used have been described previously (Schall, Hanes, Thompson, & King, 1995).
Through juice-reinforced operant conditioning, the monkeys
were trained to produce one saccade to foveate a target in a visual search array. A memory-guided saccade task with a single
stimulus (gray, 8.3 cd/m2) was used to map movement ﬁelds of
the neurons and to determine whether each neuron exhibited
saccadic movement-related activity.
Stimuli appeared on a black background (< 0.1 cd/m2) with a
white ﬁxation point (46.9 cd/m2, 0.21  0.21). The target was
randomly placed in a location at the optimal eccentricity for the
neuron whose activity was being recorded in a given session.
During color and motion search, seven evenly spaced, identical
distractors were presented along with the target; for inefﬁcient
search, difﬁculty was increased by presenting distractors that
were closer to the target in color space or that were degraded in
motion strength (Fig. 1c; see Sato et al., 2001, for speciﬁc
stimulus parameters). During spatial-conﬁguration search, the
target was a T among L distractors, or vice versa; difﬁculty was
varied by manipulating set size (one, three, or seven distractors),
and the orientation of the distractors was randomly determined
on each trial (upright or rotated by 1901, 11801, or 12701;
across sessions, the orientation of the target was rotated). Stimuli
were scaled according to the cortical magniﬁcation factor (from
0.61 at 61 eccentricity to 11 at 101 eccentricity in color search;
from 1.51 at 61 eccentricity to 2.51 at 101 eccentricity in motion
and spatial-conﬁguration search). Search difﬁculty was manipulated through target-distractor feature similarity or set size,
with different levels of difﬁculty randomly interleaved across
trials. The color, direction of motion, and form (T or L) of the
target rotated across days.
Each trial began with 600 to 1,000 ms of ﬁxation, after which
the search array was presented. Reward was withheld if a saccade was made to any location other than the target’s location.
On 10 to 35% of trials, no target was presented (catch trials), and
the monkeys were rewarded for maintaining ﬁxation for at least
750 ms after the search array appeared. For each neuron recorded, we collected data from at least 75 trials in conditions of
both efﬁcient and inefﬁcient search.

Data Analysis
Our procedures for data acquisition and analysis have been
described elsewhere (Sato et al., 2001; Thompson et al., 1996).
Error trials were excluded. Neurons were classiﬁed as movement related if they exhibited a ramp-up of activity immediately
preceding saccades during the memory-guided saccade task
(Bruce & Goldberg, 1985).

Our analyses focused on four characteristics of the activity of
movement-related neurons that could contribute to the observed
RT effects. Systematic adjustment of RTs could have been due to
changes in (a) baseline ﬁring rate, (b) the onset of movementrelated activity, (c) the threshold activation necessary to initiate
saccades, or (d) the rate of growth of activation to the threshold.
To measure the time at which movement-related activity began, we used a sliding-window algorithm that worked backward
from the initiation of the saccade to determine when movement
activity began increasing. Spike-density functions (SDFs) were
calculated using a ﬁlter with an impulse-response function
shaped like a postsynaptic potential (growth 5 1 ms, decay 5 20
ms). Trials were sorted by RT into groups of at least 10 trials. For
each RT group, the onset of movement-related activity was
calculated as the ﬁrst time point that met the following criteria:
(a) the SDF no longer decreased signiﬁcantly according to a
Spearman correlation (a 5 .05) over a time window ranging from
20 ms to 120 ms, (b) the spike density at that time was less
than the SDF during the 20 ms preceding saccade onset, and (c)
the correlation remained nonsigniﬁcant for 20 ms as the center
of the window continued to move backward from the saccade.
Baseline activity was measured as the average of the SDF
from 200 ms until the search array appeared. We measured
threshold activation as the average of the SDF in the interval 10
through 20 ms before saccade initiation (Hanes & Schall, 1996).
Growth rate was measured by subtracting the threshold-activity
level from the onset-activity level and dividing by the time interval between onset and the response. The same pattern of results was found when the growth rate was measured by ﬁtting
a regression line to the SDF for each RT group. Fifty-eight
movement-related neurons recorded from the 5 monkeys had sufﬁcient data for these analyses (40 neurons recorded during feature search and 18 neurons during spatial-conﬁguration search).
RESULTS

Color and Motion Feature Search
Mean RT across all motion and color feature-search trials was
signiﬁcantly faster in the efﬁcient-search condition (195.4 ms)
than in the inefﬁcient-search condition (245.5 ms; 50.05-ms
difference), F(1, 39) 5 87.02, p < .0001. Saccades were also
signiﬁcantly more accurate during the efﬁcient-search condition
(94.8% correct) than during the inefﬁcient-search condition
(79.5% correct), F(1, 39) 5 149.16, p < .0001.
Figures 2a through 2e show the activity of a representative
neuron during efﬁcient and inefﬁcient search. The beginning of
activation of this neuron increased systematically and signiﬁcantly with RT in both efﬁcient and inefﬁcient feature search, ps
< .05 (Fig. 2c). Saccades were initiated when the discharge rate
reached a threshold that did not vary with condition (p > .30;
Fig. 2e). Baseline activity and the rate of growth of the movement-related activity did not vary signiﬁcantly as a function of
RT (ps > .20, Figs. 2b and 2d).

Volume 19—Number 2

The sample of neurons recorded during the feature-search
tasks consistently showed that RT was related to the variation in
the beginning of movement-related activation, but not to baseline activity, threshold activation, or rate of growth. Figures 2f
through 2i show for each neuron the mean difference between
efﬁcient and inefﬁcient search for each measure of neural activity as a function of the mean difference in RT between inefﬁcient and efﬁcient search. Across neurons, baseline ﬁring
rate did not vary signiﬁcantly between the efﬁcient-search (14.2
spikes/s) and the inefﬁcient-search (14.4 spikes/s) conditions,
F < 1.0 (Fig. 2f). Similarly, the threshold for initiating a saccade
did not differ between the efﬁcient-search (64.4 spikes/s) and
inefﬁcient-search (62.7 spikes/s) trials, F < 1.0 (Fig. 2i). The
rate of growth of movement activity did not differ signiﬁcantly between efﬁcient search (0.40 spikes/s/ms) and inefﬁcient
search (0.52 spikes/s/ms; Fig. 2h); although this effect approached signiﬁcance, F(1, 39) < 3.8, p 5 .06, it should be
noted that this difference was in the direction opposite of that
predicted by continuous-ﬂow models and was driven largely by
3 of the 40 neurons from 2 monkeys. When these 3 neurons
were excluded from the analyses, the same pattern of results
was found for the other neural measures, and the difference
between the rates of growth in the two search conditions was
essentially eliminated (0.42 spikes/s/ms for efﬁcient search and
0.49 spikes/s/ms for inefﬁcient search).
However, there was a clear relation between the time of the
beginning of movement-related activity and RT (Fig. 2g). The
average beginning of movement-related activation across the 40
neurons was signiﬁcantly earlier during efﬁcient search (83.7
ms) than during inefﬁcient search (133.8 ms), F(1, 39) 5 36.48,
p < .0001. Notably, the difference in onset time of movementrelated activity between the conditions (50.1 ms) corresponded
quantitatively to the RT difference between the search conditions (50.05 ms). The strong correlation between these measures, r2 5 .846, t(38) 5 14.47, p < .001, indicates that the
difference in onset time between efﬁcient and inefﬁcient search
strongly predicts the observed RT difference. Moreover, the
difference in onset time between efﬁcient and inefﬁcient feature
search was signiﬁcant for each of the 4 monkeys, ps < .05. Table
1 shows results of further within-condition analyses.
To summarize, the data indicate that random variation of RT
within search conditions and systematic adjustments of RT
across levels of search efﬁciency arise from variation in the
beginning of movement-related activity.

Spatial-Conﬁguration Search
To test the generality of these ﬁndings, we trained a 5th monkey
to perform visual search for a target composed of two line segments (a rotated T among randomly rotated Ls, and vice versa)
embedded in search arrays with one, three, or seven distractor
objects. Search for targets deﬁned by a spatial conﬁguration of
identical line segments results in search slopes of 20 to 30 ms/

item with human observers (Wolfe, 1998). In the present study,
task performance during recordings from 18 movement-related
neurons showed similar decreases in RT with set size, and this

Note. This table presents results of within-condition analyses of data from
trials grouped by response time (RT). Each fraction indicates the number of
neurons (out of 40 during color or motion search and out of 18 during spatialconﬁguration search) for which the measure of neural activity varied signiﬁcantly across RT groups (linear regression, ps < .05).

Figures 3a through 3e show that the pattern of activity of a
representative neuron during the performance of this task was
identical to that obtained during the color and motion search
tasks. Figures 3f through 3i show the population-level data, with
each data point representing a different neuron and different
symbols indicating different neuron types. As in the featuresearch tasks, saccades were generated when movement-related
activity reached a ﬁxed threshold that did not vary across set size
(set size 2: 38.5 spikes/s, set size 4: 38.4 spikes/s, set size 8: 38.4
spikes/s), F < 1.0 (see Fig. 3i). Baseline activity did not differ
signiﬁcantly across set sizes (set size 2: 10.7 spikes/s, set size 4:
11.0 spikes/s, set size 8: 10.9 spikes/s), F < 1.0 (see Fig. 3f).
The rate of growth of activity, shown in Figure 3h, varied slightly
but signiﬁcantly with set size, F(2, 34) 5 4.56, p < .05 (set size
2: 0.27 spikes/s/ms, set size 4: 0.25 spikes/s/ms, set size 8: 0.23
spikes/s/ms), but this effect was due to the activity of two
neurons (see Table 1). Only the variation in the onset time of
the movement activity accounted for the variability in saccade
latency (see Fig. 3g). For the vast majority of neurons, the
variability of RT across set size was related to changes in
the beginning of movement activity (Table 1). This was most
evident at the larger set sizes, for which the variability of RT was
greatest. Across the neuron sample, delayed onset of the buildup
of movement-related activity accounted for the increase in RT
across set sizes. Speciﬁcally, mean onset time increased signiﬁcantly across set sizes 2 (M 5 105.9 ms), 4 (M 5 137.6 ms), and 8
(M 5 201.7 ms), F(2, 34) 5 49.82, p < .0001. Moreover, the mean
differences in onset time of movement activity between set sizes 2
and 4 (31.7 ms) and between set sizes 4 and 8 (64.0 ms) corresponded closely to the mean differences in RT between set sizes 2
and 4 (29.4 ms) and between set sizes 4 and 8 (57.5 ms).
DISCUSSION

This study addresses a question as old as experimental psychology (Donders, 1868/1969). Is RT composed of the durations
of distinct, nonoverlapping stages of processing? This question

Volume 19—Number 2

has remained undecided because of a lack of direct measures of
the start and ﬁnish times of intermediate stages (e.g., Woodworth, 1938). Measuring the activity of single neurons in monkeys performing cognitively demanding RT tasks provides new
leverage in resolving this classic problem. The activity of speciﬁc neurons in sensorimotor structures provides measures of
the beginning and duration of visual selection and response
preparation during visual search tasks requiring eye movement
responses (Bruce & Goldberg, 1985; Hanes & Schall, 1996; Sato
et al., 2001; Thompson et al., 1996). Similar logic has been
employed successfully in studies measuring event-related potentials during discrimination tasks requiring manual responses
(e.g., Smulders, Kok, Kenemans, & Bashore, 1995).
We tested competing hypotheses derived from discrete- and
continuous-ﬂow architectures by using visual search tasks that
demanded fast, accurate saccades to maximize reward. Previously reported analyses of visually responsive neurons recorded
in FEF during the performance of these tasks showed that when
visual selection of the target by the neurons took longer, RT was
slower (Sato et al., 2001). Discrete-ﬂow models predict that
movement-related activity in FEF should begin only after the
location of the target is selected by visual neurons. In contrast,
continuous-ﬂow architectures predict that movement-related
activity will begin as soon as any visual information is available.
Our results are consistent with discrete ﬂow between the perceptual and response stages. When stimulus manipulations
made search more difﬁcult, movement-related activity began
after a delay that was precisely equal to the difference in RT
between the search conditions. That is, the slower the search
RT, the greater the delay in saccade preparation. Moreover, RT
variability within each condition was best explained by variability in the beginning of movement-related activity.
Although the variability in RT during these visual search
tasks is accounted for by perceptual processing requirements
(e.g., Sato et al., 2001), other paradigms tax other stages of
processing and, therefore, other mechanisms. For example, the
variation of RT in the psychological refractory period (PRP)
paradigm, in which two targets demand speeded responses, is
accounted for by postperceptual response-selection mechanisms (Luck, 1998), and not the perceptual mechanisms taxed
during visual search (Pashler, 1991). Similarly, the ﬁndings of
Hanes and Schall (1996) indicate that RT variability in a stopsignal task with easily perceived targets is due to variability in
the postperceptual response process carried out by FEF movement neurons. The most plausible conclusion from these diverse
studies is that different task manipulations overload different
limited-capacity mechanisms at different stages of processing
(Luck & Vecera, 2002; Sigman & Dehaene, 2006; Sternberg,
2001). The isolated targets presented in RT paradigms like the
stop-signal task and the PRP paradigm likely tax response
processes differently than do set-size and target-distractorsimilarity manipulations in visual search, which overload perceptual attention mechanisms.

Fig. 3. Neurophysiological results for a representative neuron (a–e) and the population of neurons tested (f–i) during spatial-conﬁguration
search. The graph in (a) presents average spike-density functions (SDFs; sp/s 5 spikes per second) for a representative neuron for the
three set sizes. The four graphs below show (b) baseline activity, (c) onset time, (d) growth rate of activation, and (e) threshold activation
from the same neuron plotted as a function of response time (RT) and set size. The four graphs at the bottom show differences in neural
measures between set sizes 8 and 2 as a function of difference in RT between set sizes 8 and 2, for the entire sample of neurons. The neural
measures are (f) baseline activity, (g) onset time, (h) growth rate of activation, and (i) threshold activation. Each data point represents a
different neuron, and different symbols distinguish data from different neuron types (open squares: visual-movement neurons; ﬁlled
circles: pure-movement neurons). A regression line is drawn for the neural measure that varied signiﬁcantly with RT.

The present ﬁndings are consistent with the hypothesis that
the output of perceptual processing is transmitted discretely to
the response-preparation stage. Such a conclusion requires
careful consideration of the relation between the present ﬁndings and evidence that has been used to argue for continuousﬂow models. A number of event-related potential studies mea-

sured the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) as an index of
response preparation in subjects performing manual go/no-go
tasks with target stimuli composed of two features, one that was
easy to perceive and indicated the response hand (e.g., ‘‘S’’ for
the left hand, ‘‘T’’ for the right hand), and one that was more
difﬁcult to perceive and indicated whether the response should

be withheld (e.g., smaller stimulus for go and larger stimulus for
no-go; e.g., Miller & Hackley, 1992; Osman et al., 1992). These
studies found that LRP activation began before perceptual
processing of all the features of the stimulus was completed.
However, particular features of these studies may limit the
generality of their conclusions. For example, Ilan and Miller
(1998) emphasized that these studies required observers to
process stimuli that were deﬁned by a conjunction of visual
features, one of which was far easier to perceive than the other.
Given the possibility that different visual features can be encoded at different rates, such demonstrations of continuous information transmission from encoding to response preparation
could be attributed to independent encoding of different visual
features that can be transmitted discretely to a common response-preparation stage. This hypothesis has been elaborated
as the asynchronous discrete-coding model (Miller, 1982, 1988).
The asynchronous discrete-coding model provides a parsimonious account of other results from single-unit recording
studies that were interpreted as consistent with continuous ﬂow.
For example, Bichot, Rao, and Schall (2001) required monkeys
to shift gaze to a target deﬁned by color and shape and found
subthreshold movement-related activity in the FEF when the
stimulus in the movement ﬁeld shared a feature with the target.
This subthreshold movement-related activity could have been
due to partial preparation of the eye-movement response because the item in the movement ﬁeld matched one of the features
of the target object. Likewise, results from studies of the skeletomotor system using conjunction stimuli were interpreted as
reﬂecting continuous ﬂow between perceptual and movementrelated neurons, although it is possible that these effects were
due to one of the features of a nontarget matching the searchedfor target (Miller, Riehle, & Requin, 1992; Riehle, Requin, &
Kornblum, 1997). Thus, using targets deﬁned by multiple stimulus features, single-unit studies have obtained data consistent
with either the continuous-ﬂow hypothesis or the asynchronous
discrete-coding hypothesis. In contrast, another single-unit study
that monitored activity in the primary somatosensory and motor
cortex of macaque monkeys detecting tactile stimulation on
different digits obtained data entirely consistent with discrete
ﬂow (Mouret & Hasbroucq, 2000).1
Although we propose that the asynchronous discrete-coding
hypothesis accounts for the difference between the present and
previous ﬁndings, we acknowledge several boundary conditions
in drawing these conclusions from our data. First, the absence of
catch trials in the conjunction-search experiment of Bichot et al.
(2001) meant that a movement was necessary for reward on every
trial. Accordingly, speed may have been emphasized more than
accuracy. Conﬁguring the visual-motor system for continuous
transmission would afford greater speed at the cost of accuracy,
and evidence consistent with top-down control of information
1

Mouret and Hasbroucq tested a single monkey, so the generality of their
ﬁndings could not be assessed.

ﬂow has been obtained in electrophysiological studies (Gratton,
Coles, & Donchin, 1992; Low & Miller, 1999) and behavioral
paradigms (e.g., McElree & Carrasco, 1999). In fact, speedaccuracy adjustments may occur through strategic slowing of
response processes (e.g., Ridderinkhof, Ullsperger, Crone, &
Nieuwenhuis, 2004). Thus, it is possible that the present task
context discouraged the use of partial perceptual information to
prepare the saccades, unlike the task used by Bichot and his
colleagues. Future research will need to test whether the system
can be reconﬁgured between discrete-ﬂow and continuous-ﬂow
states to accommodate task demands. Second, although we
found evidence for the discrete transmission of information
across the perception-action boundary, it is possible that information ﬂows continuously between other intermediate stages of
processing (Sternberg, 1969). Finally, it is possible that saccades localizing search targets might not be prepared on the
basis of partial information, whereas manual responses could be
guided by partial output.
Despite certain limitations of interpretation, the present ﬁndings demonstrate that activation of a population of neurons instantiating response preparation begins later when search RT is
longer, a ﬁnding consistent with the discrete-ﬂow hypothesis. Our
results also verify a key assumption of the additive-factors method
by showing that manipulating a factor that selectively inﬂuences
the duration of the perceptual stage changes the beginning but not
the duration of the subsequent response-preparation stage. Although these results cannot rule out every form of continuous or
cascaded information transmission, they at least force models
based on such transmission to mimic discrete transmission during
search tasks like those used in the present study.
