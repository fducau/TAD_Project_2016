ABSTRACT—Three studies examined the relationships among
anger, gender, and status conferral. As in prior research,
men who expressed anger in a professional context were
conferred higher status than men who expressed sadness. However, both male and female evaluators conferred
lower status on angry female professionals than on angry
male professionals. This was the case regardless of the
actual occupational rank of the target, such that both a
female trainee and a female CEO were given lower status if
they expressed anger than if they did not. Whereas women’s emotional reactions were attributed to internal characteristics (e.g., ‘‘she is an angry person,’’ ‘‘she is out of
control’’), men’s emotional reactions were attributed to
external circumstances. Providing an external attribution
for the target person’s anger eliminated the gender bias.
Theoretical implications and practical applications are
discussed.

During an appearance on a national news program, the chairman
of the Republican National Committee asserted that Senator
Hillary Clinton was too angry to be elected president (Nagourney,
2006). This comment caught the media’s attention because it
appeared to be motivated by her gender:
They are casting Hillary Clinton as an Angry Woman, a shemonster melding images of Medea, the Furies, harpies . . . . This
gambit handcuffs Hillary: If she doesn’t speak out strongly against
President Bush, she’s timid and girlie. If she does, she’s a witch
and a shrew. (Dowd, 2006, p. A21)

Though politicians have always used such tactics to defame
their opponents, this particular case raises interesting questions
about whether expressing anger impedes a woman’s chances at
winning a political race or gaining status in other professional
arenas. Generally, emotion theorists suggest that displays of
certain emotions, such as anger, can communicate that an
individual is competent and is entitled to high social status
(Shields, 2002, 2005; Tiedens, 2001). In a study consistent with
this hypothesis, Tiedens (2001) found that men who expressed
anger in professional settings were more likely to be hired than
men who expressed sadness and were also given more status,
power, and independence in their jobs.
As Senator Clinton’s experience suggests, however, professional women who express anger may experience a decrease,
rather than an increase, in their status. Women are expected to
be kinder and more modest than men, and they evoke negative
responses from other people if they fail to conform to this prescriptive stereotype (Heilman, 2001; Rudman, 1998). Female
professionals who express anger violate this feminine norm and
therefore may not experience the boost in status enjoyed by
angry men (a possibility acknowledged by Tiedens, 2001).
This idea converges with Ekman and Friesen’s (1969) concept
of emotional display rules, which are ‘‘overlearned habits about
who can show what emotion . . . males should not cry; females,
except in a maternal role, should not show anger’’ (Ekman, 1984,
p. 320). Such an effect is likewise predicted by Rudman and
Fairchild’s (2004) integrative model of stereotype-based backlash. In their model, counterstereotypical actions are expectancy violations that provoke negative reactions from social
perceivers. However, this backlash occurs only if a justiﬁcation
for derogating the counterstereotypical individual is available.
In typical workplace situations in which a woman has expressed
anger, there is probably enough ambiguity about the reason for
her anger that some basis for derogation can be found. As a

result, negative responses to women who express anger could
occur readily in professional contexts.
Moreover, the expectation that a woman will not express anger
publicly should affect attributions for the cause of her anger.
Kelley’s (1967, 1973) attribution model stipulates that when a
person’s behavior is characterized by low consensus (i.e., is
different from that of peers), social perceivers are likely to attribute the behavior to internal characteristics (e.g., perceive
anger as stemming from disposition, as opposed to features of the
situation). According to this model, because anger and pride are
the only emotions that people believe men express more than
women (Plant, Hyde, Keltner, & Devine, 2000), a woman’s anger
should be seen as internally caused (e.g., ‘‘she is an angry person,’’ ‘‘she is out of control’’) rather than externally instigated
(e.g., ‘‘the situation was frustrating’’). Thus, people should view a
man’s anger as a response to objective, external circumstances,
but a woman’s anger as a product of her personality. As a result, a
professional woman’s anger may imply that she is not competent
at dealing with workplace situations, and may therefore lead
perceivers to accord her less status.
OVERVIEW OF THE PRESENT RESEARCH

We report here three studies that tested these hypotheses. Study
1 examined whether participants conferred lower status on an
angry woman than on an angry man and whether attributions for
emotional reactions underlay the relation between expression of
anger and conferral of status. Study 2 examined whether any
low-status individual, and not just women, would be given low
status after expressing anger and whether the internal attribution that angry female targets were ‘‘out of control’’ mediated the
relation between expression of anger and conferral of status.
Finally, Study 3 examined whether an angry woman who offered
an external attribution for her anger would be accorded status as
high as that of an angry man. Generally, people should view a
man’s anger as a response to objective, external circumstances,
but a woman’s anger as a product of her personality. As a result, a
woman who expresses anger in the workplace will be accorded
lower status than a man who does the same, unless she emphasizes the external circumstances that caused her anger.
All analyses reported in this article included gender of the
participant as an independent variable. No interactions involving
this variable were signiﬁcant, and therefore we collapsed across
gender for all analyses.
For all the studies reported in this article, we recruited adult
participants in order to obtain a relatively representative, noncollege-student sample with workplace experience (Sears, 1986).
We recruited these adult participants by placing ﬂyers advertising the study at locations throughout a public park in Connecticut. Participants contacted us if they were interested in
participating, completed the experiment individually in isolated
laboratory rooms on campus or at a private off-campus location,
and were compensated with their choice of a lottery ticket or

$1.00. Most were Caucasian (85% on average), well educated,
and politically moderate (M 5 3.91 on a 7-point liberalismconservatism scale).
STUDY 1

Method
Participants and Procedure
Thirty-nine males and 30 females (mean age 5 38.75 years)
were randomly assigned to view a videotaped job interview in
which either a male or a female professional described feeling
either anger or sadness. The study employed a 2 (target’s gender:
male vs. female)  2 (emotion: anger vs. sadness) betweensubjects design.
We obtained the videotapes used by Tiedens (2001) and
created two additional videotapes using a female target pretested to be equivalent to Tiedens’s male target in attractiveness,
age, and ethnicity. In all three studies reported here, targets
wore professional attire and were ostensibly being interviewed
for a job while sitting at a table; the interviewer was out of view of
the camera. Targets described an incident in which they and a
colleague lost an important account, and when asked by the
interviewer how it made them feel, responded that the incident
made them feel either angry or sad.
Dependent Measures
Participants completed dependent measures in the order listed
in this section.
Status Conferral. Following Tiedens (2001), we created a composite measure of status conferral. This measure included four items
assessing how much status, power, and independence the candidate deserved in his or her future job (1 5 none, 11 5 a great
deal) and whether the participant would hire the target person
(1 5 never, 11 5 deﬁnitely; a 5 .91).
Salary. Participants reported the yearly salary they would pay
the target.
Competence. Participants rated the target on the trait dimensions of competent-incompetent and knowledgeable-ignorant,
using 11-point trait semantic differential scales (a 5 .79).
Attributions. Two questions assessed internal attributions (i.e.,
‘‘she/he became angry because of her/his personality,’’ and ‘‘she/
he is an angry person’’), and two questions assessed external
attributions (‘‘she/he became angry because of the situation with
her/his colleague,’’ and ‘‘her/his colleague’s behavior caused
her/his anger’’). These four questions were answered using 11point scales (1 5 completely disagree, 11 5 completely agree).
We reverse-scored the internal-attribution items and summed
all four responses to create a composite measure (a 5 .72).

Results and Discussion
Table 1 presents mean scores for all four targets for all of the
dependent measures. We hypothesized that there would be an
interaction between emotion and the target’s gender. Speciﬁcally, we expected to replicate Tiedens’s (2001) ﬁnding that an
angry man receives higher status, a higher salary, and higher
competence ratings than a sad man. We also expected that participants would give the angry woman lower status and lower salary
than the angry man, would perceive her as less competent than
the angry man, and would be more likely to attribute her anger
than his to internal, dispositional causes.
Status Conferral
A 2 (target’s gender: male vs. female)  2 (emotion: anger vs.
sadness) analysis of variance (ANOVA) conducted on the statusconferral scores revealed a signiﬁcant interaction, F(1, 64) 5
16.38, prep 5 .996. As in Tiedens’s (2001) study, participants
conferred higher status on the angry male target than on the sad
male target, t(32) 5 3.59, prep 5 .986. Participants also conferred signiﬁcantly higher status on the angry male than on the
angry female, t(31) 5 3.85, prep 5 .986.1 Furthermore, participants conferred signiﬁcantly higher status on the sad female
than on the angry female, t(32) 5 2.07, prep 5 .882.
Salary
The salary measure also showed a signiﬁcant interaction between gender of the target and emotion expression, F(1, 55) 5
5.46, prep 5 .921. Participants were willing to pay the angry male
more than the sad male, t(26) 5 1.77, prep 5 .840, and signiﬁcantly more than the angry female, t(25) 5 3.05, prep 5 .966.
Participants were willing to pay the angry female marginally less
than the sad female, t(29) 5 1.51, prep 5 .778.
Competence
Perceptions of competence likewise showed a signiﬁcant
interaction between the target’s gender and emotion expression,
F(1, 65) 5 7.56, prep 5 .956. Participants viewed the angry male

as signiﬁcantly more competent than the sad male, t(32) 5 3.91,
prep 5 .996. As expected, participants also viewed the angry male
as signiﬁcantly more competent than the angry female, t(32) 5
2.99, prep 5 .966. However, the sad female was not seen as significantly more competent than the angry female.
Attributions
Attributions also showed a signiﬁcant interaction between the
target’s gender and emotion expression, F(1, 63) 5 5.20, prep5
.915. As expected, participants attributed the woman’s anger
more to internal factors and less to external factors than the
male’s anger, t(31) 5 2.44, prep 5 .927. Moreover, attributions
partially mediated the effects of expressing anger on the status
accorded female professionals (Baron & Kenny, 1986). When we
controlled for attributions, the coefﬁcient (b for anger was signiﬁcantly reduced, from .59 to .35, Sobel z 5 2.20, p < .05.
However, the effects of anger remained signiﬁcant, which suggests that attributions partially accounted for the observed
effects.
STUDY 2

The results of Study 1 suggest that expressing anger is an
effective means of attaining higher status for professional men,
but not for professional women. To replicate Tiedens (2001), we
used sadness as a comparison emotion in Study 1. However,
sadness has its own unique connotations and therefore may not
be a neutral control. Thus, in Study 2, we compared the effects of
anger and of expressing no emotion.
In Study 2, we also varied the targets’ occupational rank.
Perhaps angry women are given lower status than angry men
simply because women, on average, have lower status than men
initially. People may ﬁnd it presumptuous for any low-status
person, male or female, to display a high-status emotion such
as anger. But if an angry woman receives lower status than an
angry man because of her gender, expressing anger should reduce her status regardless of whether she is a powerful executive
or a lowly trainee.
In Study 2, we also attempted to clarify why angry women are
accorded low status by employing a more targeted measure
of internal attributions—belief that angry women are out-of-

asked how the situation made them feel and, in general, were
instructed to not express emotion. In pretesting, participants
accurately labeled the angry actors’ emotion and rated the different actors’ anger as similarly intense and sincere, Fs < 1; all
participants indicated that the no-emotion actors were not expressing emotion.

control individuals. To the extent that anger is attributed to the
individual’s personality rather than external circumstances,
expressing that anger is likely to be perceived as a self-regulation failure. Therefore, we hypothesized that participants
would view an angry woman as being out of control, and that this
internal attribution would help explain why angry women are
accorded low status.

Results and Discussion
Table 2 presents the mean scores for the eight targets for all of
the dependent measures.

Method
Participants and Procedure
Participants (70 males, 110 females; mean age 5 42.46 years)
were randomly assigned to view one of eight videos. The study
utilized a 2 (target’s gender: male vs. female)  2 (emotion: anger
vs. no emotion)  2 (occupation: high vs. low rank) betweensubjects design.

Status Conferral
A 2 (target’s gender: male vs. female)  2 (emotion: anger vs. no
emotion)  2 (occupation: high vs. low rank) ANOVA conducted
on status conferral revealed a main effect of the target’s occupational rank, F(1, 174) 5 9.25, prep 5 .974, and an interaction
between the target’s gender and emotion expression, F(1, 174) 5
6.69, prep 5 .95. For female targets, only a main effect of emotion
expression emerged, F(1, 85) 5 5.12, prep 5 .915; women were
accorded lower status when they expressed anger than when
they were unemotional. For the male targets, only a main effect
of target’s occupational rank emerged, F(1, 85) 5 7.28, prep 5
.956.

Dependent Measures
As in Study 1, participants completed measures of perceived
competence, status conferral, and salary allocation. An additional item assessed the speciﬁc attribution that the target was,
in general, an ‘‘in control’’ or ‘‘out of control’’ person (1 5 out of
control, 11 5 in control).
Stimulus Materials
Professional actors, different from those in Study 1 and matched
for age (middle to late 30s), ethnicity (Caucasian), and attractiveness, played the part of the interviewee in the videos. (In
pretesting, 19 participants rated the actors as similarly attractive and believed they were the same age, Fs < 1.) The script
was identical to that used in Study 1 except that at the beginning
of the interview, targets described their occupation (either lowrank assistant trainee or high-rank CEO) and, in the no-emotion
condition, the targets were not asked how they felt as a result of
the botched work situation.
In the anger condition, the actors appeared moderately angry
when responding to the interviewer’s question, ‘‘How did that
make you feel?’’ In the no-emotion condition, the actors were not

Salary
Results for salary paralleled those for status conferral. A threeway ANOVA conducted on salary allocation revealed a main
effect of the target’s occupational rank, F(1, 155) 5 7.07, prep 5
.953, and a signiﬁcant two-way interaction between the target’s
gender and emotion expression, F(1, 155) 5 3.03, prep 5 .840.
Participants’ suggested salary for the female targets was not
based on their occupational rank, but rather was based on
whether the targets expressed anger or remained unemotional.
Participants were willing to pay the unemotional female targets
more than the angry female targets, even when the targets were
high-rank CEOs, F(1, 80) 5 4.13, prep 5 .883. In contrast,
participants were willing to pay the male CEOs more than the

male trainees, regardless of their expression of emotion, F(1, 75) 5
7.61, prep 5 .959.
Competence
The competence scores showed a two-way interaction between
gender of the target and emotion expression, F(1, 172) 5 7.52,
prep 5 .959, as well as a three-way interaction, F(1, 172) 5 4.82,
prep 5 .910. The two-way interaction mirrored the pattern found
for status conferral and salary, and the three-way interaction
indicated a particularly negative response to the high-rank angry female target. A planned contrast indicated that participants
rated the angry female CEO as signiﬁcantly less competent than all the other targets, t(172) 5 3.01, prep 5 .953.
Mediational Analyses
For the internal-attribution ratings, a three-way ANOVA revealed the theoretically expected two-way interaction between
gender of the target and emotion expression, F(1, 172) 5 5.78,
prep 5 .938. A planned contrast indicated that participants viewed
the angry female targets as signiﬁcantly more out of control than
the angry male targets and the unemotional male and unemotional female targets, t(174) 5 4.80, prep 5 .986.
A series of regression analyses tested the prediction that
perceptions of angry women as out of control would explain their
failure to attain high status. For female targets, expression of
anger was signiﬁcantly related to the internal attribution of being
out of control, r(89) 5 .39, p < .01, and status conferral, r(89) 5
.23, p < .05. Furthermore, internal attribution was related to
status conferral, r(89) 5 .46, p < .001. When we used internal
attribution and emotion expression as independent variables
to predict status conferral, only the coefﬁcient for internalattribution ratings remained signiﬁcant, b(89) 5 .44, p < .001.
The coefﬁcient for emotion expression fell from .23 to .06 and was
no longer signiﬁcant, Sobel z 5 2.87, p < .01. Thus, the internal
attribution that an angry woman was out of control fully mediated
the relationship between her expression of anger and the status
she was accorded (Baron & Kenny, 1986).

STUDY 3

Studies 1 and 2 found that angry women are accorded lower
status than angry men, and Study 2 indicated that this is true
regardless of the woman’s actual status (i.e., whether she is a
CEO or an assistant trainee). Moreover, attributions appear to
play a role in this phenomenon: People may confer low status on
an angry woman because they see her behavior as arising from
something deep and inherent—that is, from her being an angry
and out-of-control person. If inherent, internal attributions underlie this phenomenon, then an intervention designed to direct
attributions away from internal factors and toward external
factors might be effective at mitigating the bias. Lending support
to this hypothesis, Heilman and Okimoto (2007) demonstrated

272

that preventing negative attributions for violations of genderbased norms reduces penalties for counterstereotypical behavior. Therefore, in Study 3, we tested the hypothesis that if an
angry female professional provides an objective, external reason
for being angry, she should evoke less negative reactions.
Experimentally manipulating this proposed mechanism (i.e.,
attributions)—rather than treating it as a continuous variable—
would further establish its validity as a mediator of the bias
against angry women (Spencer, Zanna, & Fong, 2005).
The potential effectiveness of such an intervention is also
supported by Rudman and Fairchild’s (2004) model of backlash
effects. They proposed that violations of prescriptive gender
stereotypes are most likely to provoke negative reactions when a
potential rationalization for derogating the stereotype violator is
available. To the extent that an angry female professional can
provide an objective, external reason for being angry, she should
evoke less negative reactions.
Method
Participants and Procedure
Participants (51 males and 82 females; mean age 5 38.70 years)
watched one of six videos. The study utilized a 2 (target’s gender:
male vs. female)  3 (emotion: unexplained anger vs. explained
anger vs. no emotion) between-subjects design. There was no
external-attribution condition for the no-emotion condition because it was not plausible to offer an external attribution for not
expressing emotion.
Dependent Measures
Participants completed measures of status conferral, salary allocation, and competence.
Stimulus Materials
The videotapes from Study 2 were used, but with two modiﬁcations. The information about the target’s occupational status
was removed, and in the explained-anger condition, the target
made an external attribution for his or her anger—that a coworker lied to the target by telling him or her that he had directions to the client’s ofﬁce. This lie caused the target and
coworker to lose the account.
Results and Discussion
Table 3 presents the mean ratings for the targets for all of the
dependent measures.
Status Conferral
For status conferral, a 2 (target’s gender: male vs. female)  3
(emotion: anger without external attribution vs. anger with external attribution vs. no emotion) ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant
interaction between the target’s gender and emotion expression,
F(2, 34) 5 9.72, prep 5 .999. Examining each gender separately,
we found that the angry male without an external attribution

received signiﬁcantly higher status than the unemotional male,
t(44) 5 2.55, prep 5 .95, and the angry male with an external
attribution, t(45) 5 2.11, prep 5 .892. Results for the female
targets supported our prediction; the angry female target who
provided an external attribution for her anger received signiﬁcantly higher status than the angry female target who did not
provide an external attribution, t(44) 5 3.53, prep 5 .986, but
did not receive higher status than the unemotional female target, t(45) 5 0.22, prep 5 .251. Notably, the status conferred on
the angry female target with an external attribution was not
signiﬁcantly different from the status conferred on the angry
male targets with or without a reason for their anger. This ﬁnding further suggests that our intervention attenuated the backlash against
the angry female.
Salary
The results for salary paralleled those for status conferral. A 2
(target’s gender: male vs. female)  3 (emotion: anger without
external attribution vs. anger with external attribution vs. no
emotion) ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant interaction between the
target’s gender and emotion expression, F(2, 112) 5 6.90, prep 5
.986. Looking at each gender separately, we found that the angry
male target without an external attribution received a signiﬁcantly higher salary than the unemotional male target, t(38) 5
1.75, prep 5 .84, and the angry male target with an external
attribution, t(35) 5 1.79, prep 5 .842. For female targets, the
angry female who provided an external attribution for her anger
received a higher salary than the angry female who did not provide a reason for her anger, t(40) 5 3.24, prep 5 .979, but did not
receive a higher salary than the unemotional female target, t(36)
5 0.44, prep 5 .383. The salary allocated to the angry female
target who provided an external attribution was not signiﬁcantly
different from the salary allocated to the angry male targets with or
without a reason for their anger.
Competence
For competence, the interaction between target’s gender and
emotion expression did not reach statistical signiﬁcance, F(2, 134)
5 2.24, prep 5 .807. Thus, although having an external attribution
for her anger gave the angry female target a boost in status, it
apparently did not inﬂuence perceptions of her competence.

GENERAL DISCUSSION

The present studies document new phenomena at the nexus of
gender, emotional display rules, perceptions of status, and attributions for behavior. For men, expressing anger may heighten status: Men who expressed anger in a professional context
were generally conferred higher status than men who expressed
sadness.
For women, however, expressing anger had the opposite effect: Professional women who expressed anger were consistently
accorded lower status and lower wages, and were seen as less
competent, than angry men and unemotional women. And unlike
men’s occupational rank, women’s occupational rank (i.e., CEO
vs. trainee) did not inﬂuence status conferral, salary allocation,
or judgments of competence. The derogated status of angry
women appeared to be due to the degree to which their behavior
was seen as internally motivated—in particular, to the perception that they were out of control. But when an angry woman
offered an external attribution for her anger, she did not suffer
the same loss in perceived status and competence.
These ﬁndings are consistent with the hypothesis that anger is
a status emotion (Shields, 2002; Tiedens, 2001). Moreover, they
converge with prior theories regarding the nature of emotional
display rules (Ekman, 1984), as well as with the predictions
of Rudman and Fairchild’s (2004) model of stereotype-based backlash. Finally, the ﬁnding that the nature of behavioral attributions
partly underlies status conferral for female targets is consistent
with Kelley’s (1967, 1973) attribution model, which predicts
that behaviors perceived as different from those of one’s peers
(e.g., for women, expressing anger) are often given personalitybased explanations. Participants’ attributions of a woman’s anger to internal causes (e.g., ‘‘she is an angry person,’’ ‘‘she is
out of control’’) helped to explain the low status they conferred
on her.
The present ﬁndings complement, but can be distinguished
from, those of previous work examining discrimination against
women who violate prescriptions for self-promotion. Women who
promote their abilities are perceived as less likeable and less
hireable than women who do not promote their abilities—but
they are still seen as competent (Rudman, 1998). At the same
time, women as a group are seen as warm, but relatively in-

Anger, Gender, and Status Conferral

competent (Eagly & Mladinic, 1993; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu,
2002). The explanation for why self-promoting women are seen
as competent, but angry women are seen as relatively incompetent, may be that women who self-promote are explicitly asserting their competence, whereas angry women are not—they
are simply emoting.
Although women’s anger appears to be sanctioned in a professional context, it may not be sanctioned in a family context
(Kring, 2000; Tavris, 1982). Also, it is not clear whether this bias
against angry women applies in professional contexts other than
job interviews and early impression formation. It is possible that
coworkers acquire more individuated information about each
other over time, so that this bias becomes less relevant. Additionally, the targets in the present studies were White American
men and women, and it remains an empirical question whether
our ﬁndings hold for individuals of other ethnic groups, such as
African American and Hispanic American men and women.
Further, the importance of maintaining harmony in collectivistic
cultures (Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1995) suggests
that in much of the world, public expressions of anger by both
women and men may evoke negative reactions. Future research
should examine these possibilities.
Turning to real-world situations, such as the remarks about
Senator Clinton, one might ask, what can women do to mitigate
potential backlashes in response to anger? Professional women
face a dilemma: On the one hand, anger may serve as a powerful
professional tool—for instance, to compel other people to fulﬁll
their responsibilities, or to castigate them for incompetence
(Shields, 2002). On the other hand, to achieve and maintain
high social status, professional women may also have to behave
‘‘unemotionally’’ so that they are seen as rational (Albright,
2003). Thus, it is important to identify strategies that professional women can use to express anger without incurring a social
penalty.
The present studies take a step in this direction, demonstrating
that external, situational explanations for anger ameliorate
negative responses to angry women. Speciﬁcally, a woman can
express anger without incurring a drop in status to the extent that
her behavior evokes an external attribution for her anger. These
results suggest a strategy that the social target herself can use, in
contrast to interventions that focus on social perceivers (e.g.,
accuracy motivation; Neuberg & Fiske, 1987) or institutional
factors (e.g., outcome dependency; Rudman, 1998). Thus, by
offering external, situational explanations for anger, professional
women may be able to express anger, while simultaneously fulﬁlling one of the most basic social motivations: gaining status and
power.
