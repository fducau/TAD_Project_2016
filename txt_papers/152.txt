Genes and Popularity
Evidence of an Evocative Gene-Environment Correlation
S. Alexandra Burt

Extant research on gene-environment interplay centers almost
exclusively on environmental moderation of genetic expression
(G  E interaction). However, there is another key source of
gene-environment interplay: gene-environment correlation (rGE).
Such correlations are deﬁned as nonrandom environmental exposure, such that individuals elicit (i.e., evocative rGE) or select
(i.e., active rGE) experiences consistent with their genotypes
(Plomin, DeFries, & Loehlin, 1977; Scarr & McCartney, 1983).
Though rGE is acknowledged to be a fundamental component
of gene-environment interplay (Rutter & Silberg, 2002) on
theoretical grounds, the difﬁculty of disambiguating characteristics of the individual from his or her experiences has stymied
empirical support for rGE. Indeed, no study (see Jaffee & Price,
2007) has yet directly evaluated the core proposition of evocative rGE: Are particular social experiences evoked by one’s
genotype? The aim of the current study was to do just this via a
novel design combining molecular genetics and social psychology experimental techniques.
METHOD

Two samples of undergraduate men (average age 5 19) at a large
Midwestern research university participated in this study.
Sample 1 consisted of 132 men in 32 groups; 127 of the men were
included in analyses (5 were excluded because they had little
usable DNA or their DNA did not amplify). These participants
were representative of the area’s ethnic composition; 80% were
European American. Sample 2 consisted of 88 European
American men who participated in 23 groups; 82 of these men
were included in analyses (6 were excluded because of DNA
issues).
Each group, consisting of 3 to 5 previously unacquainted
individuals, completed party-planning and brain-teaser tasks
(intended primarily to promote interactions among group
members). After 45 to 60 min, participants adjourned to individual rooms to complete sociometric rankings (on a scale from 1

to 4, with 1 meaning ‘‘I liked this person best’’; ratings were
reverse-scored prior to analysis) and ratings (on a scale from 1 to
10, with 1 meaning ‘‘strongly dislike relative to other people I
know’’) of each group member.
The two-way random-effects social relations model (SRM;
Kenny, 1994) was used to analyze the sociometric data. The
SRM estimates, among other things, what are referred to as
partner effects. Partner effects index each participant’s general
tendency to be liked by other group members irrespective of that
participant’s own tendency to like others. This model thus allowed me to disambiguate each participant’s social preferences
from those of others, so that I could explicitly capture the
evocative component of peer selection (hereafter referred to as
‘‘popularity’’).
Analyses focused on a polymorphism within the promoter
region of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor gene (-G1438A, also
known as rs6311). The serotonergic system has been robustly
tied to social selection in ambiguous social settings (see Insel &
Winslow, 1998). For example, in a randomized, double-blind
design, Knutson et al. (1998) administered a selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a placebo to normal volunteers for 4
weeks. Socially afﬁliative behaviors increased in the group receiving the SSRI and had a correlation of .65 with plasma SSRI
levels. As the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor, including -G1438A,
has been associated with SSRI response (Choi, Kang, Ham,
Jeong, & Lee, 2005; Kato et al., 2006), it seemed plausible that
-G1438A is involved in social status.
DNA was obtained via Oragene (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada)
saliva collection kits. -G1438A was analyzed on an ABI 7900HT
sequence detection system using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and assays, according to Applied Biosystems (Foster
City, CA) protocols. Allele frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium in both samples, w2(1, Ns 5 127 and 82) < 1.1, n.s.
FINDINGS

In both samples, rankings and ratings contained signiﬁcant
partner effects (which accounted for 14–24% of the variance in
the rankings and ratings). This result indicates that there was

consensus within groups concerning each member’s popularity.
Partner effects for ratings and rankings were highly correlated
(r 5 .82, p < .001) and were therefore averaged to indicate
popularity in subsequent analyses. -G1438A was signiﬁcantly
associated with popularity (see Table 1), accounting for 5 to 8%
of its variance. Critically, the association found in Sample 1 was
largely replicated in Sample 2,1 which suggests that the effect is
robust to sampling variation. Such ﬁndings are consistent with
those of prior studies linking serotonergic activity to social
status in ambiguous social settings (Insel & Winslow, 1998;
Knutson et al., 1998). To my knowledge, however, the current
study is the ﬁrst to extend these results to the molecular genetic
level of analysis. These new ﬁndings offer the most direct evidence to date of an evocative rGE whereby individuals’ genes
predispose them to particular social outcomes.
It is important to note that these ﬁndings apply only to ﬁrst
impressions. It is unclear how they map onto actual friendships.
The speciﬁc behaviors mediating the observed association also
remain unidentiﬁed. As it is not biologically feasible for
-G1438A to code directly for other individuals’ social preferences, future research should identify the socially relevant behaviors driving this association. Also, the results suggest a
nonlinear or dominant effect of the G allele in Sample 1, and a
linear or dose-response effect in Sample 2. Future research
should clarify whether one or two G alleles are necessary for the
effect. Finally, this study examined only one polymorphism in

In Sample 1, the variance explained increased from 4% (square of the
Pearson correlation) to 8% when the analysis allowed for nonlinearity. By
contrast, R2 remained unchanged in Sample 2 (5% for correlation, 5% for
contrast codes), though only the correlation was statistically signiﬁcant (likely
because estimating more than one parameter attenuates power in small samples).

two small samples of adolescent males. Future research should
examine other polymorphisms in larger samples that include
females.
Despite these limitations, the current results suggest that
individuals’ genes predispose them not only to particular behaviors, but also to the social consequences of their behaviors.
These ﬁndings highlight the pervasive (if indirect) role of genetic inﬂuences on the human experience. Though the current
study does not address the long-term consequences of these
evocative experiences, one would expect them to moderate the
future expression of genetic inﬂuences. Put differently, rGE
effects are likely to underlie (and perhaps confound) any Genotype  Peer interactions. Thus, researchers should consider
rGE when attempting to investigate G  E.
