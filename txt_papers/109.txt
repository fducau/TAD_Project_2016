ABSTRACT—Recent

accounts of the development of grammar propose that children remember utterances they hear
and draw generalizations over these stored exemplars.
This study tested these accounts’ assumption that children
store utterances as wholes by testing memory for familiar
sequences of words. Using a newly available, dense corpus
of child-directed speech, we identiﬁed frequently occurring chunks in the input (e.g., sit in your chair) and
matched them to infrequent sequences (e.g., sit in your
truck). We tested young children’s ability to produce these
sequences in a sentence-repetition test. Three-year-olds
(n 5 21) and 2-year-olds (n 5 17) were signiﬁcantly more
likely to repeat frequent sequences correctly than to repeat
infrequent sequences correctly. Moreover, the 3-year-olds
were signiﬁcantly faster to repeat the ﬁrst three words of
an item if they formed part of a chunk (e.g., they were
quicker to say sit in your when the following word was
chair than when it was truck). We discuss the implications
of these results for theories of language development and
processing.
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about language is its compositional nature—the fact that a limited number of sounds can
be arranged in unfamiliar combinations to produce novel meanings. So impressive is such productive grammar that researchers
have often argued it would be impossible to learn—it must
somehow be innate. However, a number of recent accounts propose
that children acquire the grammar of their native language (or

languages) simply by observing patterns and generalizations in
the input. One such view that has been gaining in popularity is
the constructivist, or usage-based, account (e.g., Goldberg,
2006; Tomasello, 2003).
According to this account, children begin with a restricted set
of utterances taken directly from experience and acquired via
the domain-general skills of imitation and intention reading.
Children then advance to productive syntax by generalizing over
these utterances. This account relies on certain controversial
assumptions. The most fundamental is that children are able to
store whole sequences of words taken directly from the input.
Although naturalistic observation supports this assumption
(e.g., Clark, 1970; Lieven, Behrens, Speares, & Tomasello,
2003; Peters, 1983), no experimental work has tested it. The
study reported in this article tested experimentally whether
children store and reuse sequences of multiple words.
One reason one might expect children to store more than individual words in memory is that they do not hear demarcated
words in the input; words and phrases run into one another and
must be detected in the speech stream. Recently, it has been
argued that children could segment speech by observing how
regularly sounds co-occur in the language. Sounds that occur
together frequently can be taken to be words or components of
words. Conversely, word boundaries can be posited at points
where low-frequency transitions between sounds are observed
(Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996; Thiessen & Saffran, 2003). A
child performing segmentation in this fashion is likely to arrive
at an inventory of segments containing not just conventional
words, but also a number of multiword sequences.
Figure 1 illustrates this argument by showing the frequency of
units of between one and ﬁve words observed in a 1.7-millionword corpus of one mother’s speech to her child (see the Method
section for details). The ﬁgure plots frequency against rank on

Stored Word Sequences

Fig. 1. Frequency of linguistic units plotted against their rank order, on logarithmic scales. Each line shows results for units of a different length
(one through ﬁve words). Examples of four-word sequences and single words are also plotted. The data were derived from a corpus of 1.72 million

logarithmic scales. The graph shows that there are many multiword sequences (e.g., what do you think) that occur more frequently than single words (e.g., learn, pet) that are part of the
core vocabulary of English. Furthermore, there are multiword
sequences (e.g., a cup of tea) that occur with a frequency almost
equal to that of their component words (e.g., cup, tea). Given
such a pattern of frequencies, an efﬁcient language processor
could be expected to extract form-meaning mappings for the
whole phrase, as well as for individual words.
The prediction that children should extract multiword phrases
from the speech stream is supported by models built to segment
everything from artiﬁcial strings (e.g., Elman, 1990; Perruchet
& Vinter, 1998) to child-directed speech (Brent, 1999; Brent &
Cartwright, 1996), transcribed adult conversational speech (Cairns,
Shillcock, Chater, & Levy, 1997), and written texts (de Marcken,
1996; Kit & Wilks, 1999). This work has consistently shown that
if models are to avoid oversegmenting (erroneously identifying word parts as words), they must undersegment to some
degree; that is, they must extract a large number of ‘‘common
sequences that incorporate more than one word, but . . . co-occur
frequently enough to be treated as a quasi-unit’’ (Elman, 1990,
p. 193). From an information-theoretic point of view, there is

242

also good reason to think that multiword storage continues to be
the most efﬁcient strategy available to the child even after full
segmentation is possible. Shannon (1948) pointed out that when
selecting a code to transmit information over some channel
(a situation that has useful analogies to the child ﬁnding appropriate speech segments with which to produce and receive
messages), an efﬁcient strategy must consider the frequency
with which different units occur. If one assumes that in language
processing it is efﬁcient to reduce the number of segmentretrieval operations required, then given the high frequency with
which many multiword sequences appear, the additional storage
cost of keeping such sequences in the lexicon in addition to
individual words would be justiﬁed by the performance gains.
That the best code, given the statistics of natural language, includes multiword elements has been repeatedly shown by both
minimum-description-length modeling (e.g., Kit & Wilks, 1999)
and related work in text compression (e.g., Ziv & Lempel, 1978).
Although these analyses are suggestive, there is little experimental work testing children’s retention of frequent multiword
sequences. Studies that have demonstrated effects of frequency
on children’s grammatical knowledge have done so only at the
single-word level (e.g., Ambridge, Rowland, Pine, & Young, 2008;

Kidd, Lieven, & Tomasello, 2006; Marchman, 1997; Matthews,
Lieven, Theakston, & Tomasello, 2005; Matthews & Theakston,
2006) or at most for combinations of two words (Rowland,
2007; for related ﬁndings with adults, see, e.g., McDonald &
Shillcock, 2003; Pluymaekers, Ernestus, & Baayen, 2005; Reali
& Christiansen, 2006). The current study tested whether frequency effects can be observed for longer sequences.
The logic of the current experiment is based on a classic study
of an analogous problem in inﬂectional morphology. Taft (1979)
sought to establish whether people always process words by
decomposing them into their component morphemes (e.g., dogs >
dog 1 s), or whether people sometimes process words directly as
wholes. He reasoned that if the frequency of whole forms affects
processing independently of the frequency of their components,
then it must be the case that people store information about the
whole forms. Identifying pairs of words in which one whole form
had a very high frequency (e.g., things) and the other a low
frequency (e.g., worlds), but in which the summed frequency of
the base form and its inﬂectional versions was the same for the
two words (e.g., frequency of world 1 frequency of worlds 5
frequency of thing 1 frequency of things), Taft reasoned that any
effect of whole-form frequency would be evidence of whole-form
storage. Participants performed a lexical decision task, and,
indeed, a processing advantage was found for the high-frequency whole forms. These results provided support for the idea
that people store some complex words as wholes.
Extending this logic, we chose as stimuli pairs of sequences
that were identical except for the ﬁnal word. In each pair, one
sequence was highly frequent (e.g., a drink of tea), and the other
was infrequent (e.g., a drink of milk), although the ﬁnal words
(tea, milk) and also the ﬁnal bigrams (of tea, of milk) within each
pair were matched for frequency. We hypothesized that children
would show a processing advantage for the frequent over the
infrequent sequence in each pair. As the ﬁrst three words (the
‘‘stems’’) within each pair were identical and the ﬁnal words and
bigrams were matched for frequency, any such effect would
necessarily result from the whole combinations of words and not
the component words or pairs of words. This effect would therefore be evidence that children store information about frequent
sequences of words.
We used a repetition task to probe children’s knowledge. There
is evidence that when asked to repeat sequences of words,
children analyze what they hear and reproduce it as they would a
regular utterance (Potter & Lombardi, 1990; see also Kidd et al.,
2006; Valian & Aubry, 2005). In the current study, we hypothesized that children would more easily and accurately repeat
high-frequency than low-frequency combinations.
METHOD

Participants
Thirty-eight normally developing, monolingual, English-speaking
children were included in the study (12 boys, 26 girls). There

Volume 19—Number 3

were seventeen 2-year-olds (range 5 2 years 4 months through 2
years 9 months, mean age 5 2 years 6 months) and twenty-one
3-year-olds (range 5 3 years 1 month through 3 years 6 months,
mean age 5 3 years 4 months). Five additional children were
tested but not included because of fussiness. The children were
tested in the Max Planck Child Study Centre, Manchester,
United Kingdom. Parental consent was obtained.

Materials and Design
We created stimuli using the Max Planck Child Language Corpus,
collected by the Max Planck Child Study Centre, Manchester.
This corpus contains the speech addressed to and produced by a
single child, Brian, when he was between the ages of 2 and 5.
It was the largest corpus of child-directed speech available to us
(1.72 million words of maternal input over 0.33 million utterances). For this experiment, we were interested in the language
that children hear, and consequently took frequencies from
Brian’s mother’s speech.
Using the method of Yamamoto and Church (2001), we extracted all repeated sequences of words from the corpus. This
provided us with the distribution of events shown in Figure 1. We
chose four-word sequences as stimuli, as four words was the
greatest length yielding a wide enough frequency range, and
four-word sequences would be sufﬁciently long to elicit variance
in participants’ performance in a repetition task (cf. Valian &
Aubry, 2005). In selecting our test sequences, we applied a
number of additional constraints. We required that (a) each
sequence had been produced by Brian’s mother at least once as a
whole utterance, and not only as part of an utterance (so repeating the string in isolation would not be unnatural); (b) no
sequence formed a question (children might be tempted to answer a question rather than repeat it); and (c) no sequence
consisted of repetitions of the same word (e.g., no, no, no, no).
Our most frequent item was I don’t know what, which occurred
260 times (a natural-log frequency of 5.56). Our log frequency
range was 0 through 5.56.
Within this set of candidates, we looked for high-frequency
sequences that could be matched with low-frequency sequences
and obtained 13 such pairs (see Table 1). All high-frequency
sequences came from the top third of the frequency range (e.g., a
lot of noise: log frequency 5 4.66). All low-frequency sequences
were from the bottom half of the frequency range, with all but one
item being in the bottom third of the frequency range (e.g., a lot
of juice: log frequency 5 0.69). The ﬁnal words of matched sequences were controlled for (a) the frequency of the ﬁnal word
(e.g., juice and noise are roughly equally frequent), (b) the frequency of the ﬁnal bigram (e.g., of juice and of noise are roughly
equally frequent), and (c) the length of the ﬁnal word in syllables. Mann-Whitney tests conﬁrmed that the high- and lowfrequency sequences did not differ signiﬁcantly in the ﬁnal
word’s frequency (U 5 68; Z 5 .847; p 5 .397, prep 5 .573) or

the ﬁnal bigram’s frequency (U 5 68.5; Z 5 .821; p 5 .412,
prep 5 .562).
For 6 of the 13 pairs of sequences, we identiﬁed a third, intermediate-frequency sequence that was matched on the same
three criteria (e.g., a lot of fruit: log frequency 5 2.08). Because
we were not able to identify an intermediate-frequency sequence
in every case, we did not include these items in our factorial design, but we presented these 6 additional sequences as test
stimuli so as to include the time it took children to repeat these
items in an additional regression analysis, as detailed in the
Results section. The order of presentation of the sequences was
fully counterbalanced across the participants. All sequences
were read by a female British English speaker with normal declarative intonation. They were recorded in a soundproof booth
onto a computer disk using SoundStudio Version 3.5 (Freeverse,
New York). The sampling frequency was 44,100 Hz. To ensure
that the ﬁrst three words of each pair were identical, we took one

244

sequence as a base and created the matched sequence by
splicing in the ﬁnal word using the open-source software Audacity Version 1.2.4 (available on the Web at http://audacity.
sourceforge.net/). We used randomly selected high-frequency
sequences as bases half the time and low-frequency sequences
as bases the other half of the time.

Procedure
The experimenter sat with the child at a table in front of a
computer (the child sat alone or on his or her parent’s knee). The
experimenter produced a picture of a tree with stars in the
branches and explained that she and the child would cover each
star with a sticker. She explained that to get the stickers, they
needed to listen to what the computer said and then say the same
thing. The experimenter offered to go ﬁrst. She then clicked on a
mouse to play the ﬁrst of six example sequences, repeated the

sequence, and awarded herself a sticker. She repeated this
procedure for the next two example sequences and then offered
the child a turn for the remaining three examples. The experimenter helped the child or replayed the practice sound ﬁles once
each if necessary. Each time the child attempted to repeat a
sequence, he or she received a sticker.
The experimenter then played the test sequences in exactly
the same manner except that no help was given and no sound
ﬁles were replayed. If the child did not spontaneously repeat a
sequence after a reasonable delay, the experimenter prompted
the child once (saying, ‘‘Can you say that?’’). If the child did not
then respond, or if anything other than this prompt came between the stimulus sequence and the repetition, the response
was excluded. A response was also excluded if the child did not
hear the stimulus sequence (e.g., if the child spoke unexpectedly as the sound ﬁle played). If a response was excluded for one
sequence in a pair, results for the other sequence in the pair were
also excluded. In the case of triads, the exclusion of either the
high- or the low-frequency item (but not of the intermediatefrequency item) resulted in the exclusion of the rest of the triad.
The procedure continued until all 32 sentences had been presented. Responses were recorded onto a computer disk using
Audacity Version 1.2.4.

Transcription and Error Coding
Two research assistants blind to the hypothesis of the experiment transcribed and coded the children’s responses from audio
ﬁles. Each word in each sequence was coded for the presence or
absence of the errors listed in Table 2. If a child did not make a
single error in an entire sequence, this sequence was coded as
correctly repeated. If a child correctly repeated a pair of sequences, or made only errors of pronunciation, then this pair was
included in the duration analysis detailed in the next section.

TABLE 2
Error Codes Used for Responses
Code

Agreement between the coders was moderately good (Cohen’s
k 5 .586). In all cases in which the ﬁrst two coders did not code a
word identically, a third research assistant, also blind to the
hypotheses of the experiment, listened to the relevant response
and resolved the discrepancy.
Duration Coding
We also coded how long, in milliseconds, it took each child to say
the ﬁrst three words of each sequence. We coded all pairs of
matched items that a child repeated without error or with errors
of pronunciation only (items with other errors were excluded, as
the durations of such items would have differed dramatically
depending on the nature of the error). The duration of intermediate-frequency items was coded when the corresponding
high- and low-frequency sequences had been repeated successfully. Applying these criteria did not leave enough data for
the 2-year-olds (68% excluded), and thus only the 3-year-olds’
responses were coded for duration (only 34% excluded).
A research assistant blind to the hypothesis of the experiment
measured the duration of each sequence from the onset of the
ﬁrst word to the onset of the fourth word using Audacity software.
The paired sequences a piece of cheese and a piece of food were
excluded because it was impossible to ﬁnd the offset of of and the
onset of food in the low-frequency sequence. We excluded the
intermediate-frequency item a lot of fruit for the same reason.
Two participants (approximately 10% of the data) were randomly
selected, and their responses were coded by a second blind coder.
Reliability was assessed by computing the Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient between the two coders (r 5 .99, indicating high
reliability).
RESULTS

All children attempted repetition of most of the items (90% of
items repeated). We report analyses based on the mean number
of items children repeated correctly and then discuss analyses of
the duration of the repeated sequences.

Correct Repetition of Sequences
For 2-year-olds, the mean proportion of correctly repeated sequences was .42 (SD 5 .28) for high-frequency sequences and
.32 (SD 5 .27) for low-frequency sequences. For 3-year-olds,
the corresponding proportions were .69 (SD 5 .19) and .65 (SD 5
.21). To analyze these data, we arcsine-transformed the proportions
and conducted 2 (age)  2 (sequence frequency) analyses of
variance by participants (F1) and by items (F2). There was no
signiﬁcant interaction between age and frequency, F1(1, 36) 5

likely to repeat high-frequency sequences correctly than to repeat low-frequency sequences correctly, F1(1, 36) 5 6.358, p 5
.016, prep 5 .935, Z2 5 .15; F2(1, 24) 5 3.561, p 5 .071, prep 5
.85, Z2 5 .129. The same pattern of results emerged when we
conducted analyses without arcsine-transforming the proportions and when we counted items that had errors on the fourth
word only as correctly repeated.

Duration of Three-Word Stems
The mean duration of the ﬁrst three words of the repeated sequences was 6,895 ms (SD 5 96.51) in the high-frequency condition
and 7,167 ms (SD 5 100.65) in the low-frequency condition.
One-tailed paired-samples t tests by participants and by items
revealed that children repeated the ﬁrst three words signiﬁcantly faster for high-frequency than for low-frequency sequences, t1(19) 5 1.923, p 5 .035, prep 5 .900, Z2 5 .156;
t2(11) 5 1.998, p 5 .034, prep 5 .902, Z2 5 .266.
To further investigate the relation between sequence frequency and duration, we ﬁtted a simultaneous multiple regression
model to the duration data, including ﬁnal-word frequency,
ﬁnal-bigram frequency, and four-word-sequence frequency as
predictor variables. Following the standard procedure for regressions over repeated measures data, we entered children into
the model using dummy variables (Lorch & Myers, 1990). Because high-, low-, and intermediate-frequency items were
matched for the ﬁrst three words, we also entered item group into
the model using dummy variables (e.g., items beginning with a
lot of were coded as one item group). The outcome variable was
the duration (in milliseconds) of the ﬁrst three words of each
sequence. These durations were log-transformed to correct for
heteroscedasticity. The results are reported in Table 3. Fourword sequence frequency was a signiﬁcant predictor of duration.
The negative beta value indicates that the more frequent a sequence, the less time children took to produce its ﬁrst three
words. The positive beta value for ﬁnal-bigram frequency suggests that the more frequent the ﬁnal bigram of a sequence, the
longer the repetition duration. We did not predict this result, but
it might suggest that the existence of a frequent bigram inhibits
the production of the whole sequence because of competition for

activation (see Sosa & MacFarlane, 2002, for a similar ﬁnding in
adults). However, this hypothesis would also predict a signiﬁcant effect for individual word frequency, which was not found.
One aspect of our stimuli that we have not yet discussed is the
frequency of the ﬁnal three words of our sequences. This variable was found to have little impact when entered as an additional predictor into our simultaneous model; the frequency of
the whole sequence remained a signiﬁcant predictor (b 5
0.021, SE 5 0.009, b 5 .130, p 5 .021, prep 5 .925), and
trigram frequency had a small positive beta (b 5 0.003, SE 5
0.014, b 5 .015, p 5 .848, prep 5 .234). We should, however, be
cautious in interpreting this result because the frequency of the
ﬁnal trigram was positively correlated with overall sequence
frequency in our stimuli, giving rise to collinearity in the model.
Although these analyses suggest that frequency of the four-word
sequence is the stronger predictor of duration in our data, we
should certainly not conclude that the frequencies of smaller
components do not affect language processing. The results are
more likely a consequence of the selection and control of our
stimuli. We maximized the variance in frequency of our fourword sequences while minimizing variance in ﬁnal-word and
ﬁnal-bigram frequency and ignoring ﬁnal-trigram frequency. We
expect that stimuli with a greater range of frequency for the
component n-grams would produce effects of frequency at those
alternative levels of granularity.
DISCUSSION

The analyses we have reported reveal that the frequency with
which word sequences occur in the linguistic environment determines the speed and accuracy with which children are able to
produce them in a repetition task. This effect is independent of
any effect of syntax, of the frequency of the component words, or
of transitional probabilities between pairs of words. This ﬁnding
is consistent with the general tendency for linguistic events that
are encountered more often to be processed more quickly (e.g.,
Howes & Solomon, 1951; see Ericsson & Kintsch, 1996, for a
discussion of expertise effects in language and other domains).
Following Taft’s (1979) reasoning about morphology, we take our
results as evidence of whole-form storage. Our speakers seem to
have had some experience-derived knowledge of speciﬁc fourword sequences. It seems probable to us that this knowledge was
in addition to their knowledge of the individual component
words (all words in our stimuli were likely to be familiar to the
children independently of the particular sequences), which suggests that the children had complementary representations at different levels of granularity.
What are the implications of this ﬁnding for models of language
processing and learning? A popular perspective in linguistics
assumes a clear distinction between lexicon and grammar
(or words and rules). In the words of Ullman (2001), ‘‘[People’s]
use of language depends upon two capacities: a mental lexicon
of memorized words and a mental grammar of rules that underlie

the sequential and hierarchical composition of lexical forms into
predictably structured larger words, phrases and sentences’’ (p.
37). Because this view incorporates a distinction between
memory-based processing at the word level and algorithm-based
processing at the multiword level, it is clearly incompatible with
our ﬁnding. A number of models do give memorized sequences a
role, varying in the extent to which they break with the wordsand-rules perspective. Some allow for storage of a very large
number of sequences, but still posit a special mode of grammatical rule- or constraint-based processing (e.g., Culicover &
Jackendoff, 2005; Jackendoff, 2002). More radical is the usagebased approach (e.g., Langacker, 1987), which disregards the
distinction between lexicon and grammar altogether, seeing all
of language production and comprehension as based on previously experienced exemplars and proposing that grammar is
emergent from ‘‘the cognitive organization of language experience’’ (Bybee, 2006, p. 730). The present results do not allow us
to determine which of these two kinds of models is correct.
However, it is worth noting that our ﬁnding that children use
multiword sequences in processing even when one would expect
individual words to be available to them supports Langacker’s
(2000) prediction that processing language using concrete, exemplar-based knowledge will be the preferred strategy when
such knowledge is available.
The claim that children simultaneously store information
about units of language at differing levels of granularity (words,
bigrams, and so on) raises some important questions for future
research. It was convenient in our introduction to refer to items
such as those we studied as ‘‘multiword’’ sequences, but it is not
clear whether the children’s representations of the sequences
overlapped with or were completely disjoint from their representations of the words that a standard linguistic analysis indicates the sequences consist of. It will be crucial to explore what
relationships exist between representations at different levels of
granularity. For example, are they mutually reinforcing, in competition, or entirely unrelated? To answer this question, one would
need to use stimuli in which the frequencies of components of
different lengths are systematically varied and pitted against
each other.
Our results also raise fundamental developmental questions.
Although the older children we tested were signiﬁcantly better
than the younger children at repeating sequences, we observed
no interaction between age and frequency. This suggests continuity in frequency effects across development. Would the effect of frequency diminish in older children or adults? Last,
researchers need to explore whether the storage of multiword
units affects not only the processing of the exemplars, but also
the processing of similar items. It is possible that the multiword
statistics of the input determine the kinds and extent of children’s generalization, thereby shaping the development of productive syntax. The ﬁndings we have presented here are an
essential ﬁrst step in developing an input-driven account of the
ontogenesis of multiword speech.
