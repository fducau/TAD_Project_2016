ABSTRACT—The current research explored whether two related yet distinct social competencies—perspective taking
(the cognitive capacity to consider the world from another
individual’s viewpoint) and empathy (the ability to connect
emotionally with another individual)—have differential
effects in negotiations. Across three studies, using both
individual difference measures and experimental manipulations, we found that perspective taking increased individuals’ ability to discover hidden agreements and to
both create and claim resources at the bargaining table.
However, empathy did not prove nearly as advantageous
and at times was detrimental to discovering a possible deal
and achieving individual proﬁt. These results held regardless of whether the interaction was a negotiation in
which a prima facie solution was not possible or a multipleissue negotiation that required discovering mutually beneﬁcial trade-offs. Although empathy is an essential tool in
many aspects of social life, perspective taking appears to
be a particularly critical ability in negotiations.

In October 1962, the United States and the former Soviet Union
came to the brink of nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Yet
in the middle of this harrowing conﬂict, President John F. Kennedy managed to devise a strategic plan to prevent potential
annihilation—a plan that also did not sacriﬁce his country’s longterm interests. While publicly refusing to remove any of America’s
missiles placed near the Soviets (i.e., no quid pro quo on missile
removal), Kennedy offered that if all nuclear weapons were
removed from Cuba, the United States would pledge not to invade

Cuba in the future. This deal allowed Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev to declare that he had saved Cuba from attack, and
therefore satisﬁed his core interests of saving face and retaining
power.
This example illustrates the powerful advantage of having a
deep understanding of one’s opponent. Kennedy’s proposal was
suggested by an advisor, Tommy Thompson, who had lived with
Khrushchev and had intimate knowledge of his fundamental
interests. In fact, in disparate domains such as chess, poker,
politics, and business, knowing the motives and likely behaviors
of an adversary can illuminate strategies to secure personal gain,
the downfall of one’s nemesis, and even long-term peace (Axelrod, 1987; Findler, 1990; Lopes, 1976; Thagard, 1992). Negotiators, for example, must often understand the other party’s
interests to obtain the best outcome for themselves (Fisher,
Ury, & Patton, 1991; Thompson, 1990; Thompson & Hastie,
1990).
Given that understanding one’s opponent is valuable for
success in competitive interactions, it seems likely that individual characteristics associated with such understanding
would prove advantageous. In this vein, two related but distinct
social competencies—perspective taking and empathy—have
been shown to motivate social understanding across a variety of
contexts. Although the terms perspective taking and empathy are
often used interchangeably, there is clear evidence of their
differences (Coke, Batson, & McDavis, 1978; Davis, 1980,
1983; Deutch & Madle, 1975; Hoffman, 1977; Oswald, 1996).
Perspective taking is a cognitive capacity to consider the world
from other viewpoints and ‘‘allows an individual to anticipate
the behavior and reactions of others’’ (Davis, 1983, p. 115).
Empathy, in contrast, is an other-focused emotional response
that allows one person to affectively connect with another.
Sometimes labeled sympathy or compassion, empathy is often
considered to be an emotion of concern experienced when

witnessing another person’s suffering (Batson, Fultz, & Schoenrade, 1987).
There is suggestive evidence that perspective taking and
empathy may not have the same effects in strategic interactions.
Perspective-taking ability is associated with personality characteristics such as high self-esteem and low neuroticism,
whereas empathy predicts emotionality (Davis, 1980, 1983).
Perspective taking, but not empathy, predicts the tendency to
mimic other people’s nonverbal behaviors (Chartrand & Bargh,
1999), a behavioral tactic that can be helpful in negotiations
(Maddux, Mullen, & Galinsky, 2008). Perspective takers are
able to step outside the constraints of their own immediate, biased frames of reference (Moore, 2005) and reduce egocentric
perceptions of fairness in competitive contexts (though not at the
expense of their own self-interest; Epley, Caruso, & Bazerman,
2006). Empathy, however, leads individuals to violate norms of
equity and equality and to provide preferential treatments
(Batson, Klein, Highberger, & Shaw, 1995). Whereas perspective-taking tendencies predict extracting concessions from one’s
opponent (Neale & Bazerman, 1983), and considering an opponent’s alternatives can counter the anchoring effects of the
opponent’s ﬁrst offer (Galinsky & Mussweiler, 2001), empathy is
associated with cooperating in prisoner’s dilemma games (Batson & Moran, 1999), even when the empathizers know that their
opponent defected previously and therefore that cooperation is
likely to be to their own detriment (Batson & Ahmad, 2001).
Although this panoply of research suggests that perspective
taking and empathy are distinct constructs, no research has
systematically explored their unique inﬂuences in strategic,
mixed-motive social interactions.
In the studies reported here, we both measured and manipulated perspective taking and empathy to explore their inﬂuence
in two negotiation tasks that represent common and challenging
barriers to understanding: conﬂicting positions that mask the
compatibility of underlying interests (Studies 1 and 2) and differing preferences and priorities (Study 3). We sought to answer
the following question: For individuals involved in mixed-motive situations, is it more effective to empathize with an opponent (have the opponent inside their heart) or to understand the
opponent’s thoughts and perspective (get inside the opponent’s
head)?
We predicted that perspective taking would be a more valuable strategy than empathy in strategic interactions. First, we
believe perspective taking helps negotiators ﬁnd the necessary
balance between competition and cooperation, between selfinterest and other-interest. Focusing only on self-interests tends
to lead to excessive aggression and obstinacy, whereas focusing
only on other-interests encourages excessive concession making, to the detriment of one’s own outcomes. A balance of attention to both self- and other-interests is critical for facilitating
creative problem solving in negotiations (Pruitt & Rubin, 1986).
Second, we contend that for purposes of securing economically
efﬁcient outcomes, cognitive appreciation of another person’s

Volume 19—Number 4

interests is more important than an emotional connection with
that person. Adam Smith (1759/2002) suggested that looking at
things from an outside perspective allows individuals to override
passions, such as excessive sympathy, that can impair the ability
to achieve efﬁcient outcomes. Perspective taking should allow
individuals both to discover efﬁcient, but hidden, solutions and
to capture more value for themselves. In contrast, we predicted
that empathy would be less effective, and might even tip the
balance too far in favor of the other side’s interests, leading individuals to miss opportunities for efﬁcient exchange while also
sacriﬁcing their own potential gains.
It is important to note that the current research is the ﬁrst to
investigate the differential impact of perspective taking and
empathy in competitive, mixed-motive interactions and the ﬁrst
to explore the effect of these social competencies in a negotiation task involving conﬂicting positions that require discovering
hidden agreements. Although previous research has explored
the effects of perspective taking and empathy separately in negotiations and prisoner’s dilemmas (Batson & Moran, 1999; Kemp
& Smith, 1994; Neale & Bazerman, 1983), none of these studies
compared perspective taking with empathy, and some conﬂated
these two constructs, both theoretically and empirically, making
it difﬁcult to pinpoint which is more important for negotiators’
success. By independently manipulating and measuring perspective taking and empathy, we sought to document the differential effects of these two social competencies in strategic
interactions.
STUDY 1

Study 1 involved a negotiation over the sale of a gas station. A
deal based solely on sale price was impossible. Speciﬁcally, the
buyer’s reservation price (the maximum he or she was authorized
to pay) was lower than the seller’s reservation price (the minimum he or she was willing to accept), resulting in a negative
bargaining zone for sale price. However, the two parties’ underlying interests were compatible: The buyer wanted to hire
managers to run the station, and the seller needed help ﬁnancing
a sailboat trip and also needed to obtain employment after returning from the trip. Thus, the parties could agree to a sale price
below the seller’s reservation price, but with a stipulation of
future employment. To reach a successful deal, participants had
to discover this alternative solution themselves during the
course of the negotiation. We predicted that, compared with
participants high in empathy, those high in perspective taking
would be more likely to reach an agreement that met both parties’ interests.

Perspective Taking and Empathy in Negotiations

Procedure
Participants were randomly assigned to dyads, playing the role
of either buyer or seller in a dyadic negotiation involving the sale
of a gas station (Goldberg, 2000). They were given conﬁdential
role instructions 1 week prior to the negotiation and were allowed 50 min to negotiate a deal face-to-face. Negotiations took
place in separate rooms during class.
The main dependent measure was whether or not dyads were
able to negotiate a deal based on the parties’ interests. An outcome was considered successful if the sale price was not greater
than the buyer’s reservation price and the deal involved at least
one additional term, such as a job for the seller upon return. An
outcome was considered unsuccessful if it involved only the sale
price of the station or if the parties reached an impasse. Thus,
the outcome measure was a dichotomous variable (successful vs.
unsuccessful or no deal) that was coded at the dyadic level.
Measures of Perspective Taking and Empathy
One week later, participants completed an on-line personality
inventory, which included Davis’s (1980) reliable and widely
used seven-item perspective-taking and seven-item empathy
scales. Items on these scales ask about tendencies toward perspective taking (e.g., ‘‘I believe that there are two sides to every
question and try to look at them both’’) and empathy (e.g., ‘‘Sometimes I don’t feel very sorry for other people when they are having
problems,’’ reverse-scored). We averaged the responses to items to
arrive at a single score for each participant for each construct.
Given that the main dependent variable was at the dyadic level,
perspective taking and empathy were also averaged for each
dyad. In addition, we assessed the Big Five personality traits
(Costa & McCrae, 1985), using the 10-item inventory (Gosling,
Rentfrow, & Swann, 2003), to ensure that any observed effects
were independent of other major personality variables.
Results and Discussion
Overall, 24 of the 35 dyads (68.6%) reached a successful deal in
this exercise.
Dyad-Level Analyses
Using simultaneous logistic regression, we examined the effects
of dyadic levels of perspective taking and empathy, the Big Five
traits, and gender on the likelihood of negotiating a deal. Only
dyads’ perspective-taking tendencies acted as a signiﬁcant
predictor of whether or not a successful deal was reached (see
Table 1). Consistent with our prediction that empathy might
impede discovery of mutually beneﬁcial opportunities, results
showed a negative relationship between empathy and discovery
of a deal, but this effect was not signiﬁcant.
Individual-Level Analyses
We also examined perspective taking and empathy separately
for each role (again controlling for the Big Five factors and
gender). Results indicated that the buyer’s chronic level of

perspective taking signiﬁcantly predicted whether or not a deal
was reached, b 5 0.37, Wald(1) 5 5.19, p 5 .023, whereas the
seller’s chronic level of perspective taking did not signiﬁcantly
predict the outcome, p > .91. Chronic levels of empathy for
either role did not predict the outcome, ps > .34. In analyses of
the Big Five traits, the only trait that signiﬁcantly predicted
whether or not a deal was reached was the station owner’s
openness to experience, b 5 0.30, Wald(1) 5 5.91, p 5 .015.
Perspective-taking tendencies (particularly in the buyer) increased negotiators’ ability to arrive at a creative solution that
met both parties’ needs. Empathy, in contrast, did not prove
effective in the negotiations. The advantages of perspective
taking were independent of the Big Five personality variables—
evidence that perspective taking contributes unique explanatory variance in negotiations.
Although we had not predicted that the advantages of perspective taking would differ between buyers and sellers, only the
buyer’s perspective-taking tendency made a difference in producing a deal. However, this result is consistent with recent
research showing the importance of the buyer’s role in soliciting
information in this gas-station negotiation (Maddux et al., 2008).
Although the seller needs to reveal personal information (not
surprisingly, the seller’s openness to experience mattered in the
current study), a deal cannot be achieved unless the buyer plays
an active role in soliciting and appreciating the value of the
seller’s disclosures. Thus, only the buyer’s perspective-taking
ability predicted deal making.

STUDY 2

We designed Study 2 to offer the ﬁrst empirical manipulation
contrasting perspective taking and empathy in a negotiation
setting. In addition, we measured each participant’s satisfaction
with how the other side treated him or her during the negotiation,
to further elucidate the likely beneﬁts of each social competency
in negotiations.

Participants
Participants were 152 full-time M.B.A. students1 who were enrolled in a negotiations course.
Experimental Manipulations
Participants were given conﬁdential role instructions (with
experimental manipulations) the same day they negotiated.
Because buyers’ perspective-taking ability proved crucial in
reaching a deal in Study 1, we experimentally manipulated perspective taking (and empathy) for buyers only, using the same
negotiation exercise from Study 1.
Buyers assigned to the control condition were simply told to
focus on their own role. Buyers in the empathy condition were
given the following instructions:
In preparing for the negotiation and during the negotiation, take the
perspective of the service-station owner. Try to understand what they
are feeling, what emotions they may be experiencing in selling the
station. Try to imagine what you would be feeling in that role.

Buyers in the perspective-taking condition were told:
In preparing for the negotiation and during the negotiation, take
the perspective of the service-station owner. Try to understand
what they are thinking, what their interests and purposes are in
selling the station. Try to imagine what you would be thinking in
that role.

Following the exercise, participants indicated how satisﬁed
they were with the way they were treated during the negotiation.
Responses were made on a 7-point scale from 1 (not at all satisﬁed) to 7 (extremely satisﬁed).

In Study 2, buyers’ perspective taking increased the probability that a dyad would arrive at a solution that met both sides’
needs. In addition, perspective taking and empathy on the part
of buyers both led sellers to be more satisﬁed with how they were
treated. Although empathy had immediate affective beneﬁts for
the other side, empathizers did not have an advantage over
control participants in producing deals that would provide longterm value for themselves and their opponents. In contrast, perspective takers secured the most agreements and did so with
sufﬁcient satisfaction on the part of their opponents.

The ﬁrst two experiments investigated whether perspective
taking and empathy would help negotiators discover the compatibility of underlying interests in the face of seemingly conﬂicting positions. Oftentimes, however, a negotiation explicitly
involves multiple issues for which negotiators have different
priorities; negotiators can improve their outcomes by conceding
on their low-priority issues in exchange for getting what they
want on their high-priority issues, a technique called logrolling
(Froman & Cohen, 1970). Mere compromise, or simply ‘‘splitting’’ all issues down the middle, results in less efﬁcient agreements compared with making mutually beneﬁcial trade-offs
(Thompson, 1990, 2001; Tripp & Sondak, 1992).
Multi-issue negotiations highlight a dilemma negotiators face:
how to ﬁnd a balance between capturing value for oneself (value
claiming) and maximizing the available resources for both parties (value creating; Lax & Sebenius, 1986). To be most effective, negotiators must both create as large a ‘‘pie’’ of resources as
possible (to produce the most economically efﬁcient agreements) and claim as much of that pie as possible (to satisfy their
self-interest).

Perspective Taking and Empathy in Negotiations

In Study 3, we manipulated perspective taking and empathy to
explore how these social competencies affect the amount of both
joint (i.e., dyad-level) and individual gain. We predicted that
perspective taking would be more effective than empathy both in
creating value and in claiming more of that increased value. In
addition, we predicted that empathy might even decrease individual gain, a measure of how well negotiators protect and pursue their own interests.

the table, in that different role.

In the perspective-taking condition, participants read:
In preparing for the negotiation and during the negotiation, take
the perspective of the candidate. Try to understand what they are
thinking in their situation. After reading your role, try to visualize
yourself on the other side of the table, in that role, thinking as the
candidate.

Method
Participants
Participants were 146 full-time M.B.A. students who were enrolled in a negotiations course.
Negotiation Exercise
Individuals participated in a two-party negotiation exercise
involving a job candidate and a recruiter. Eight issues were
negotiated, and each negotiator was given a scoring system that
detailed how much each issue was worth to him or her and what
his or her preferences were on each issue. Two issues were distributive, meaning the parties’ preferences were in complete
opposition to each other (e.g., the candidate wanted a higher
salary and the recruiter wanted to pay a lower salary, and this
issue was worth the same number of points to each of them). Two
issues were compatible, meaning that the parties’ preferences
were identical (e.g., both the candidate and the recruiter wanted
the candidate to work in San Francisco, and this issue was worth
the same number of points to each of them). Finally, the remaining four issues were integrative, meaning negotiators had
different low- and high-priority issues. For example, the candidate wanted a higher bonus and the recruiter wanted to pay a
lower bonus, but the candidate cared more about this issue; that
is, bonus was worth up to 4,000 points for the candidate, but only
1,600 points for the recruiter. In contrast, vacation time was
worth 4,000 points for the recruiter and only 1,600 points for the
candidate. Negotiators could maximize their joint gain by
agreeing on the candidate’s preferred bonus and the recruiter’s
preference for fewer vacation days. The maximum joint gain was
13,200 points.
Procedure
The procedure was similar to that for Study 2 (participants were
given their role information and negotiated in the same class
session). Participants had 30 min to negotiate.
Experimental Manipulations
Participants playing the role of the recruiter were randomly
assigned to one of three conditions. As in Study 2, participants in
the control condition were asked to consider their own role
carefully. In the empathy condition, participants read:
In preparing for the negotiation and during the negotiation, take
the perspective of the candidate. Imagine what it would feel like to

382

Dependent Measures
We had three outcome measures. To assess the discovery of
mutually beneﬁcial trade-offs, we measured joint gain, the total
points each dyad achieved together. We also coded whether
dyads reached the maximum of 13,200 points or fell short. To
assess individual gain, we analyzed the total points that each
person obtained individually.
Results
Joint Gain
An initial one-way analysis of variance indicated a signiﬁcant
main effect for condition, F(2, 72) 5 4.51, p 5 .014, Zp 2 ¼ :115.
Dyads in the perspective-taking condition (M 5 12,150, SD 5
1,064) achieved signiﬁcantly higher joint gain than dyads in the
control condition (M 5 10,961, SD 5 1,614), F(1, 45) 5 8.10,
p 5 .007, Zp 2 ¼ :156. Additionally, dyads in the empathy condition (M 5 11,711, SD 5 1,292) tended to achieve more joint
gain than dyads in the control condition, but this effect did not
reach signiﬁcance, F(1, 52) 5 3.49, p 5 .067, Zp 2 ¼ :064. Joint
gain did not differ between the perspective-taking and empathy
conditions, p 5 .22.
We next examined the proportion of dyads that maximized the
overall gain by achieving 13,200 points (the best possible collective outcome). Twelve percent of dyads in the control condition, 22% in the empathy condition, and 40% in the perspective-taking condition achieved this outcome. Although
these proportions did not differ overall, w2(2, N 5 73) 5 5.15,
p 5 .076, perspective takers were more likely to achieve the
maximum joint gain than were participants in the other two
conditions, w2(1, N 5 73) 5 4.31, p 5 .038.
Individual Gain
We examined individual gain as a function of experimental
condition (see Fig. 2), controlling for the effect of the opposing
party’s individual gain because each individual was embedded
in a negotiation dyad (see Maddux et al., 2008).
We ﬁrst conducted a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
on individual gain for participants in the recruiter role (who
received the instructions with the experimental manipulation).
In this analysis, condition was our independent variable, and the
job candidate’s (opponent’s) individual gain was a covariate.
Results showed a signiﬁcant effect of condition, F(2, 69) 5 4.02,

who negotiated with perspective-taking recruiters (M 5 5,930,
SD 5 2,129) also achieved signiﬁcantly more points than those
who negotiated with control recruiters, F(1, 43) 5 6.84, p 5 .01,
Zp 2 ¼ :14. Candidates’ individual gain did not differ between
the perspective-taking and empathy conditions, F(1, 44) < 1,
p 5 .55, Zp 2 ¼ :01.
In Study 3, taking the perspective of one’s opponent produced
both greater joint gains and more proﬁtable individual outcomes, compared with considering one’s own role carefully (i.e.,
the control condition). Perspective takers achieved the highest
level of economic efﬁciency, without sacriﬁcing their own material gains. In contrast, empathizing recruiters received the
poorest individual outcomes; the increases in joint gains in this
condition went mostly to the empathizers’ opponents. Extrapolating from the current data, we propose that the negotiator who
achieves the best individual outcome is one who takes the
perspective of an opponent who already feels empathy toward
him or her.

These three studies extend current knowledge about the relative
beneﬁts of two important social competencies—perspective
taking and empathy—for navigating strategic social interactions. Perspective taking consistently resulted in greater success than empathy, regardless of whether these constructs were
measured or manipulated. Perspective takers were able to uncover underlying interests to generate creative solutions when a
prima facie deal was not possible (Studies 1 and 2) and crafted
more efﬁcient deals with greater collective and individual gain
than did empathizers and control participants (Study 3). Thus,
understanding the interests and motives of opponents in competitive decision-making interactions appears to be more valuable than connecting with them emotionally.
Empathy was generally less useful than perspective taking,
and was, at times, a detriment to both discovering creative solutions and self-interest. However, it is possible that the positive
interpersonal capital empathizers build up in an initial negotiation (as shown in increased levels of sellers’ satisfaction in
Study 2) could facilitate future agreements between negotiators,
such that the outcome beneﬁts of empathy may emerge over
time. By increasing the other side’s satisfaction with the negotiation process, empathy may be particularly helpful in types of
negotiation other than those examined in the current studies. For
example, in disputes, negotiators often come to the table angry
and with a desire to be heard, and empathy may help calm them
and soften outbursts that can escalate conﬂict. Similarly, empathy may be particularly valuable in mediation, as negotiators
involved in mediation often need to be satisﬁed with the process
before agreeing to a deal.
It is also notable that having a perspective-taking partner was
advantageous for negotiators in all three studies. Thus, it may be
beneﬁcial for negotiators to encourage their partners to do some
perspective taking, as well as empathizing. From a practical
standpoint, the effects of our perspective-taking manipulations
also indicate that individuals can learn to consider other viewpoints. Even brief but active perspective taking while preparing
for a negotiation can yield improved individual and joint outcomes.
The current research suggests that in mixed-motive interactions, it is better to ‘‘think for’’ than to ‘‘feel for’’ one’s adversaries—more beneﬁcial to get inside their heads than to have them
inside one’s own heart. Given the current results, the peaceful
conclusion of something as volatile as a nuclear standoff between
two superpowers seems less like a surprise, and more like a
predictable outcome born of effective perspective taking.
