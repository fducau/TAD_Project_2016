ABSTRACT—Children’s acquisition of fundamental biological concepts (LIVING THING, ANIMAL, PLANT) is shaped by the
way these concepts are named. In English, but not Indonesian, the name ‘‘animal’’ is polysemous: One sense includes all animate objects, and the other excludes humans.
Because names highlight object categories, if the same name
(‘‘animal’’) points to two different, hierarchically related
biological concepts, children should have difﬁculty settling
on the scope of that term and its close neighbors (e.g.,
‘‘alive’’). Experiments with 4- to 9-year-old English- and
Indonesian-speaking children revealed that ‘‘alive’’ poses
unique interpretive challenges, especially for Englishspeaking children. When asked to identify entities that are
‘‘alive,’’ older Indonesian-speaking children selected both
plants and animals, but their English-speaking counterparts tended to exclude plants, which suggests that they may
have misaligned ‘‘alive’’ with one of the ‘‘animal’’ senses.
This work underscores the importance of considering language and cultural factors in studying the acquisition of
fundamental concepts about the biological world.

A considerable amount of research has focused on ‘‘folkbiological’’ knowledge, or people’s everyday knowledge about
living things. This work has revealed that an appreciation of
the fundamental concept LIVING THING1 (including plants and
animals) is a late and laborious developmental achievement.

attribute life status to inanimate objects that appear to move
on their own (e.g., clouds, bicycles). He interpreted this
‘‘childhood animism’’ as a reﬂection of children’s inchoate grasp
of concepts, including ANIMAL and LIVING THING. More recent
evidence indicates that even 10-year-olds have difﬁculty
understanding the scope of LIVING THING (Hatano et al., 1993).
In this article, we take a fresh look at children’s apparent
difﬁculty establishing the concepts ANIMAL, PLANT, and LIVING
THING. To identify the antecedents to 10-year-olds’ well-documented difﬁculties understanding these concepts, we examine
the developmental trajectories of children from 4 to 9 years of
age. We propose that the way in which these concepts are named
within a given language shapes their acquisition. We pursue this
proposal by comparing children speaking English and Indonesian, a pair of languages with intriguing differences in the names
for key biological concepts.
Our focus on naming is motivated by extensive documentation
that names, and nouns in particular, serve as a catalyst in object
categorization from infancy (see Waxman & Lidz, 2006, for a
review) through adulthood (Goss, 1961). By 12 months of age,
children use names as invitations to form categories (Waxman &
Markow, 1995). Infants’ ability to form an object category (e.g.,
ANIMAL) when presented with a set of disparate exemplars (e.g., a
dog, a horse, and a duck) improves dramatically when these exemplars are introduced with the same name. For infants as young
as 9 months old, this facilitative effect is speciﬁc to words (and not
tones), and by the age of 14 months, it is speciﬁc to nouns (and not
adjectives or verbs; Balaban & Waxman, 1997; Waxman & Booth,
2001). If naming supports object categorization in infants and
young children, then the names children learn for biological entities should inﬂuence their categorization of those entities.
There is also evidence suggesting that at least some basic
folkbiological concepts (e.g., ANIMAL) emerge early, and well in

advance of their names. Infants are especially interested in
animate objects and are captivated by animate properties, including faces, eyes, and autonomous, biological motion (Bertenthal, 1993; Johnson, Slaughter, & Carey, 1998; PoulinDubois & Shultz, 1990). Infants distinguish between animate
and inanimate objects (Woodward, Sommerville, & Guajardo,
2001) and between agents and nonagents (Leslie, 1994). Perhaps not surprisingly, then, notions of animacy are evident in
preschoolers’ reasoning (Gelman, 1990).
If names serve as invitations to form categories, then the
names that children hear for biological entities should bolster
any concepts for such entities that young children may have
already discovered (e.g., ANIMAL) and should support the acquisition of related concepts they have yet to discover. Decades
of ethnobiological research provide insights into how biological
entities are named across diverse languages (Berlin, 1992), and
the evidence is surprising. The overarching concept LIVING
THING rarely, if ever, is named with a single, dedicated noun.
Reference to this concept is almost always accomplished by
means of a phrase (e.g., living thing in English). Thus, although
in principle a dedicated name could support the acquisition of
this abstract concept, this support rarely is present. In contrast,
most languages name the concept ANIMAL. This, coupled with an
early appreciation of animacy, likely supports the early acquisition of ANIMAL.
There is, however, one potentially important complicating
factor (see Fig. 1). In many languages, including English, the
name ‘‘animal’’ is polysemous: It can refer to all animate objects

English

(ANIMALinclusive), but can also refer to the more restrictive concept
that excludes humans (ANIMALcontrastive).
This polysemy could have adverse consequences: If nouns
support the formation of object categories, and if the same name
‘‘animal’’ points to two different, but hierarchically related
concepts, then it should be difﬁcult for children to settle on its
meaning. This is a testable hypothesis, because this polysemy is
not universal. In Indonesian, for example, ‘‘animal’’ refers only
to the more restrictive ANIMALcontrastive concept (see Fig. 1). The
ANIMALinclusive concept is unnamed. Neither a dedicated noun
nor a commonly used phrase is associated with this unnamed
concept.
To test this hypothesis, we recruited children acquiring either
Indonesian or English in monolingual households in Jakarta and
Chicago, respectively. The children in the two cities were recruited from urban elementary schools that served families of
comparable relative socioeconomic status. Jakarta, Indonesia’s
capital, is a diverse city with a rich mixture of cultural practices
and serves as the center for political and economic activity. Both
majority- and minority-culture children were included (children
from Native- and Chinese-Indonesian families in Jakarta and
children from families of European and non-European descent
in Chicago). No detectable differences in task performance were
associated with this variable.
In preliminary experimentation, we asked whether children’s
interpretations of ‘‘animal’’ accord with those of adults in the
same linguistic community. We presented 95 English-speaking
6- and 9-year-olds and 102 Indonesian-speaking 6- and 9-year-

olds with a photograph of a human, asking, ‘‘Could you call this
an ‘animal’?’’ (‘‘Mungkinkah ini ‘hewan’?’’ in Indonesian).
The children’s responses mirrored those of adult speakers.
Indonesian-speaking children overwhelmingly endorsed the
ANIMALcontrastive interpretation, with only 3% asserting that a
human could be included in the category named ‘‘animal.’’
English-speaking children endorsed the ANIMALinclusive interpretation signiﬁcantly more often (26%) than the Indonesian
children.
In another preliminary study, we examined whether children’s
categorization of human and nonhuman animals mirrored their
naming practices. We presented 60 English-speaking 6- and 9year-olds and 65 Indonesian-speaking 6- and 9-year-olds with a
set of cards depicting various living and nonliving things, and
asked them to place ‘‘the kinds of things that belong together in
the same pile.’’ Performance on this free-sorting task indeed
reﬂected the children’s naming practices: Indonesian-speaking
children were less likely than their English-speaking counterparts to place a human with a nonhuman animal. Only 5% of the
Indonesian-speaking 6- and 9-year-olds placed a human with a
nonhuman animal, whereas 36% of the English-speaking 6- and
9-year-olds did so, w2(1, N 5 123) 5 17.89, p < .001.
These preliminary ﬁndings establish that children’s interpretation of ‘‘animal’’ accords with the naming practices of their
ambient linguistic community, and that this interpretation is
reﬂected in their performance in a free-sorting task. Children
acquiring Indonesian are sensitive to one unambiguous interpretation of ‘‘animal,’’ but children acquiring English are sensitive to two interpretations (ANIMALcontrastive and ANIMALinclusive).
These insights provided the foundation for a more detailed experimental investigation.
The main experiment was designed to address two issues.
First, we wanted to know whether the difference between English and Indonesian would persist in a more structured task that
was speciﬁcally designed to tap into the overarching concept
LIVING THING. Second, we considered the consequences of the
polysemy of ‘‘animal’’ in English. Preliminary work had established that Indonesian-speaking children endorsed one meaning, almost exclusively applying the ANIMALcontrastive interpretation to ‘‘animal,’’ but that, in contrast, English-speaking
children endorsed either the ANIMALcontrastive or the more abstract
ANIMALinclusive interpretation. This observation, coupled with
evidence that children favor a ‘‘one word–one concept’’ approach in word learning (Markman & Wachtel, 1988), suggests
that English-speaking children should be open to aligning a
word other than ‘‘animal’’ with the ANIMALinclusive concept, should
a suitable candidate arise.
An examination of parental input to English-speaking children suggests one such candidate. A recent analysis (Leddon,
Waxman, & Medin, 2007) of parent-child conversations in the
CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000) revealed that Englishspeaking parents apply ‘‘die’’ and ‘‘grow’’ to all living things,
but use ‘‘alive’’ more restrictedly, applying it almost solely to

316

animals (human and nonhuman), and excluding plants. This
usage offers English-speaking children an opportunity to
(mis)align ‘‘alive’’ with ANIMALinclusive and thus to circumvent the
polysemy of ‘‘animal.’’ Notice that if children adopt this interpretation, then when they are asked about ‘‘alive’’ (as in most
experiments probing biological knowledge), they should exclude plants. Indeed, when English-speaking children are asked
to sort objects on the basis of the predicate ‘‘alive,’’ they systematically exclude plants (Carey, 1985; Opfer & Siegler, 2004;
Piaget, 1926/1929; Waxman, 2005). Moreover, in Japanese and
Hebrew—two other languages in which the word for ANIMAL is
polysemous—children also tend to deny that plants are alive
(Hatano et al., 1993; Stavy & Wax, 1989).
If in attempting to resolve the polysemy of ‘‘animal,’’ Englishspeaking children (mis)align ‘‘alive’’ with the less-preferred
ANIMALinclusive sense, then their tendency to include plants when
sorting on the basis of ‘‘alive’’ should be attenuated relative to
their tendency to include plants when sorting on the basis of
other biological predicates. Moreover, this interpretive difﬁculty
with ‘‘alive’’ should be more pronounced for English- than Indonesian-speaking children, as the latter presumably have no
such polysemy to resolve.
METHOD

Participants
Participants were 4-year-olds (56 American: mean age 5 4.52
years; 46 Indonesian: mean age 5 4.72 years), 6-year-olds

age 5 6.28 years), and 9-year-olds (53 American: mean
age 5 9.42 years; 48 Indonesian: mean age 5 9.08 years)
from urban elementary schools in greater Chicago and Jakarta.
At each age and site, approximately 53% of the children were
girls.

Procedure
Each child was instructed to sort the 17 cards three different
times, on the basis of three different predicates (‘‘alive,’’ ‘‘die,’’
and ‘‘grow’’). To begin, the experimenter and child identiﬁed
each photograph. The experimenter then shufﬂed the cards and
initiated the sorting task, beginning with the predicate ‘‘alive.’’
Presenting the cards individually, she instructed the child to
‘‘put the ones that are ‘alive’ here’’ (indicating one side of the
table) and ‘‘the ones that are not ‘alive’ here’’ (indicating the
other side of the table). Next, she shufﬂed the cards and instructed the child to sort them on the basis of one of the other
predicates. When that sort was completed, she shufﬂed the cards
and gave instructions for the third sort. The order in which ‘‘die’’
and ‘‘grow’’ were presented was counterbalanced across participants.
Coding
We assigned each child’s sort to one of the following patterns,
permitting one error of omission and one of commission:


ANIMALinclusive:

humans and nonhuman animals sorted together, with plants and all others excluded
 LIVING THING: all living things sorted together, with all others
excluded
 NATURAL KIND: all living things and natural kinds sorted together, with others excluded
 other: no discernible pattern
RESULTS

As Figure 2 shows, by the age of 6 years, English- and Indonesian-speaking children appreciate an overarching concept
LIVING THING, as evidenced by their performance with the
predicates ‘‘die’’ and ‘‘grow,’’ but their interpretation of ‘‘alive’’
follows a more protracted developmental trajectory.
Consider ﬁrst the predicates ‘‘die’’ and ‘‘grow.’’ Four-year-olds
in both language communities produced a large proportion of
‘‘other’’ sorts, which suggests that they found this task difﬁcult.
Those who did produce a discernible pattern favored the LIVING
THING pattern (or, in the case of Indonesian-speaking children
sorting on ‘‘die,’’ the LIVING THING and ANIMALinclusive patterns).
Among 6-year-olds, this pattern predominated, and by age 9, the
majority of children produced it. Nonparametric analyses of the
proportion of children producing each of the three patterns revealed that at each age and in each language community, the
distribution differed signiﬁcantly from expected chance values,
w2s(1) > 9.22, ps < .01 (Ns for these tests ranged from 16 to 52).
Thus, by the age of 6 years, most children appreciate a concept
of living things and apply the biological predicates ‘‘die’’ and
‘‘grow’’ to this inclusive concept.
A very different trajectory was observed for ‘‘alive.’’ Again, 4year-olds produced a large proportion of ‘‘other’’ sorts. But an
analysis of the distribution of the remaining patterns revealed

Volume 19—Number 4

that in both language communities, 4-year-olds who produced a
discernible pattern favored the ANIMALinclusive pattern (excluding
plants), w2(1, N 5 33) 5 18.82, p < .001, for English-speaking
children and w2(1, N 5 31) 5 12.78, p < .01, for Indonesianspeaking children. Six-year-olds’ responses were distributed
evenly among the three patterns, w2(1, N 5 53) 5 5.30, n.s., for
English-speaking children and w2(1, N 5 34) 5 2.56, n.s., for
Indonesian-speaking children; this suggests that children in
both language communities have difﬁculty settling on the scope
of this term. Among 9-year-olds, however, performance in the
two language communities diverged: English-speaking children
continued to distribute their responses evenly, w2(1, N 5 51) 5
2.26, n.s., but Indonesian-speaking children strongly favored
the LIVING THING pattern, w2(1, N 5 48) 5 50.89, p < .001. The
ANIMALinclusive pattern (corresponding to a concept unnamed in
their language) virtually vanished.
DISCUSSION

In the current work, we explored how the acquisition of biological concepts is inﬂuenced by the naming practices of children’s linguistic communities. Preliminary evidence revealed
that some English-speaking, but no Indonesian-speaking,
children endorse two different meanings of ‘‘animal,’’ and that
this difference is mirrored in children’s free sorting.
More detailed experimental work revealed the conceptual
consequences of the polysemy of ‘‘animal.’’ Although children
from both language communities appreciated an abstract LIVING
THING concept, as witnessed by their interpretation of ‘‘die’’ and
‘‘grow,’’ their interpretation of ‘‘alive’’ varied as a function of
language. Indonesian-speaking 9-year-olds successfully applied this term to LIVING THING. However, their English-speaking
counterparts showed a persistent and pernicious difﬁculty, as
would be expected if they had (mis)aligned ‘‘alive’’ with the
ANIMALinclusive concept, and not the more abstract LIVING THING
concept. This suggests that the term ‘‘alive’’ poses unique interpretive challenges for English-speaking children.
These results open several avenues for future work. It will be
important to learn more about how children represent the (often
covert) ANIMALinclusive, or ANIMATE, concept. There is strong evidence that infants are sensitive to this concept, even in advance
of language. What is less clear is the developmental fate of this
concept for individuals who acquire languages, like Indonesian,
in which the concept remains unnamed. This issue relates directly to investigations concerning the role of language in preserving sensitivity to unnamed concepts (Hespos & Spelke,
2004; Levinson, Kita, Haun, & Rasch, 2002; Li & Gleitman,
2002).
It will also be important to discover how (and how deeply)
representations of this concept are affected by language.
Clearly, language does matter. English-speaking children, who
are sensitive to the polysemy of ‘‘animal,’’ have difﬁculty interpreting the closely related predicate ‘‘alive.’’ Children who

speak Indonesian, which has no such polysemy, establish the
scope of the term ‘‘alive’’ more readily, and by 9 years of age
overwhelmingly attribute life status to plants, as well as animate
beings. Finally, it will be important to discover whether this
difference is attributable to the polysemy of ‘‘animal’’ in English
or the unnamed status of ANIMALinclusive in Indonesian. To answer
this question, researchers will need to look to languages in
which the ANIMATE node has a name and the name is not polysemous. Czech appears to be one such language: ANIMALinclusive

is named (živočich), and this name is distinct from that for ANIMALcontrastive (zvı́ ře).
