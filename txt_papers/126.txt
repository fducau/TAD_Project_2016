ABSTRACT—We

examined the prospective association between general intelligence (g) at age 10 and liberal and
antitraditional social attitudes at age 30 in a large (N 5
7,070), representative sample of the British population
born in 1970. Statistical analyses identiﬁed a general
latent trait underlying attitudes that are antiracist, proworking women, socially liberal, and trusting in the democratic political system. There was a strong association
between higher g at age 10 and more liberal and antitraditional attitudes at age 30; this association was mediated
partly via educational qualiﬁcations, but not at all via occupational social class. Very similar results were obtained
for men and women. People in less professional occupations—and whose parents had been in less professional
occupations—were less trusting of the democratic political
system. This study conﬁrms social attitudes as a major,
novel ﬁeld of adult human activity that is related to
childhood intelligence differences.

Important differences in people’s social attitudes and views are
captured under the broad syndrome of the traditional-moralvalues triad (Koenig & Bouchard, 2006; Saucier, 2000). The
correlated dimensions of this triad are conservatism-traditionalism, authoritarianism, and religiousness. Inﬂuential work on
these concepts emerged in attempts to understand how apparently ordinary individuals became involved in the atrocities of
World War II. Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswick, Levonson, and
Sanford (1950) developed the Fascism (F) scale as part of their
now-classic The Authoritarian Personality. Also inﬂuential was
Altemeyer’s (1981, 1988) concept and scale of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). To understand the origins of these atti-

tude differences, psychologists have examined their correlations
with mental ability, as well as their developmental origins.
The balance of evidence shows that people with higher cognitive ability tend to hold less authoritarian attitudes as measured by the F and RWA scales, and scales assessing related
constructs (for overviews, see McCourt, Bouchard, Lykken,
Tellegen, & Keyes, 1999, p. 987, and Scarr & Weinberg, 1981,
p. 400). Most studies in this area have been cross-sectional. The
study reported by McCourt et al. is typical, ﬁnding a correlation
of .37 between IQ and RWA. Complementary ﬁndings indicate
that higher mental ability tends to be positively associated with
more liberal social attitudes and autonomous reasoning about
social situations. Intellectually gifted adolescents’ higher scores
on the Deﬁning Issues Test (based on Kohlberg’s theory of moral
reasoning) were accounted for by higher intelligence rather
than other psychological variables (Sanders, Lubinski, & Benbow, 1995). There is a moderate correlation between intelligence and ego development (Cohn & Westenberg, 2004;
Loevinger, 1976, 1993).
The issue of the developmental origins of social attitudes has
been examined, but more rarely, in twin, adoption, and longitudinal studies. Data from twin (Martin et al., 1986; McCourt et
al., 1999) and adoption (Scarr & Weinberg, 1981) studies contradicted the assumption that variance in social attitudes derives principally from shared environments (Altemeyer, 1988),
and found substantial genetic contributions. In a longitudinal
study, people with higher nonverbal ability at age 11 were more
likely to have nontraditional views of marriage at 33 (Flouri &
Buchanan, 2001).
Despite such evidence, longitudinal studies of the relation
between childhood intelligence and liberal, antitraditional social attitudes have been rare, and samples to date have not been
large and population-representative. Moreover, it is important
formally to model the inﬂuences of education and socioeconomic position. We conducted the study reported here to address
these issues, taking our data from the British Cohort Study 1970
(Elliott & Shepherd, 2006), which provides large, population-

representative samples of men and women who took mental tests
at age 10 and were followed up 20 years later to assess their
social attitudes and views. For the ﬁrst time, we tested the hypothesis that higher general intelligence at age 10 is associated
with more broad-minded attitudes toward social issues at age 30.
We examined potential confounding inﬂuences from parental
social class and possible mediating effects of the individual’s
education and own social class as an adult.
METHOD

Participants
The British Cohort Study 1970 is an ongoing longitudinal study
of the 17,198 individuals who were born between April 5 and 11,
1970, to parents residing in Great Britain (Elliott & Shepherd,
2006). At age 30 years, 11,261 participants were interviewed,
and 11,070 (83% of the original cohort who were alive and living
in the United Kingdom) completed questions on their social
attitudes. In total, data on mental ability at the age of 10 years
were available for 8,091 of these individuals. Full data for the
analyses presented here were available for 7,070 participants
(64% of those who completed the questions on their social attitudes).

Data Collected at Age 10 Years
Mental Ability
Mental ability was assessed using a modiﬁed version of the
British Ability Scales (Elliot, Murray, & Pearson, 1978), adapted to facilitate administration by teachers. Verbal ability was
assessed using two subscales: Word Deﬁnitions and Word Similarities. For the Word Deﬁnitions subscale, the teacher articulated each of 37 words in turn and asked the child about its
meaning. For each of the 42 items in the Word Similarities
subscale, the teacher enunciated 3 words (e.g., ‘‘orange,’’ ‘‘banana,’’ and ‘‘strawberry’’) and asked the child to name another
word consistent with the theme. Nonverbal ability was also assessed using two subscales. For the Recall of Digits subscale (34
items), the teacher read out digits at half-second intervals and
asked the child to repeat them. For the Matrices subscale (28
items), the teacher asked the child to draw in the missing part of
an incomplete pattern. Children were tested individually by
teachers, who recorded the answers for the ﬁrst three tests.
Parental Occupation
Parental social class was determined from the father’s occupation using four categories derived from the United Kingdom
Registrar General’s Classiﬁcation of Occupations (Ofﬁce of
Population Censuses and Surveys, 1980): professional-managerial, skilled nonmanual, skilled manual, and semi- or unskilled. Mother’s occupation was used to assess parental social
class if no father was present.

Data Collected at Age 30 Years
Education
At age 30, participants were asked about their highest academic
or vocational qualiﬁcations. These qualiﬁcations were subsequently collapsed into six categories. In order of increasing attainment, these categories were as follows: no qualiﬁcations,
Certiﬁcate of Secondary Education Grades 2 to 5/National Vocational Qualiﬁcation (NVQ) Level 11 and equivalent, O level
exams/NVQ Level 2 and equivalent, A level exams/NVQ Level
3 and equivalent, postsecondary degree or diploma/NVQ Level
4 and equivalent, or higher degree/NVQ Level 5.
Occupation
Each participant’s current social class (professional-managerial, skilled nonmanual, skilled manual, or semi- or unskilled) was
derived from his or her own occupation.
Attitudes
Participants completed a computer-administered, self-report,
50-item questionnaire about their attitudes to and views of the
following: support for the work ethic, support for authority,
support for traditional marital values, permissiveness about
work and family, opposition to family life, political cynicism,
left/right political beliefs, support for equality of the sexes,
environmentalism, antiracism, learning, and information technology. Each item had ﬁve possible responses: strongly agree,
agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree.
The Results section provides more information on this questionnaire.
RESULTS

Principal Components Analysis of the Attitudes Items
First, we used principal components analysis to examine the
structure of the attitudes items administered at age 30. Both the
scree slope and the eigenvalues (the number greater than 1.0)
suggested a model with ﬁve components, accounting for 52% of
the total variance. The oblimin-rotated components were examined for items that had salient loadings (> .4). We refer to the
rotated components as factors. Factor 5 did not have a coherent
set of items and had a low alpha (.56), so it was not considered
further. The four factors included in our analysis were the following:
 Factor 1: political trust. Seven items had high (negative)
loadings on this factor. They included ‘‘There is one law for
the rich and one for the poor’’ ( .66) and ‘‘Politicians are in
politics for their own beneﬁt’’ ( .58).
 Factor 2: antiracism. Five items had high loadings on this
factor. They included ‘‘I wouldn’t mind if a family of a

The NVQs are national examinations, with Levels 1 and 2 normally taken at
16, the minimum age for leaving school, and Level 3 taken at age 18; Level 4 is
postsecondary, and Level 5 is postgraduate.

effect of parental occupational social class and the potentially
mediating effects of the person’s education and own occupational social class at age 30 were considered. Table 1 presents
the correlations and the means and standard deviations of the
variables, separately for men and women.
We constructed a structural equation model to test the
key hypothesis. The four British Ability Scales subtests were
used as indicators of a latent trait of general mental ability (g).
The four attitudes scales were used as indicators of a latent trait
of general liberal and nontraditional attitudes. Paths in the
model were set according to time. Thus, childhood mental ability
and parental social class (which were allowed to correlate) were
assumed to inﬂuence education, which in turn inﬂuenced occupational social class at age 30, which in turn was hypothesized
to inﬂuence social attitudes at age 30. All direct and mediating
paths were included in the model. The Wald and Lagrange
Multiplier tests were used to indicate paths that could be
dropped and added to the model, respectively, to improve the ﬁt.
The model was ﬁrst ﬁtted to the men’s data, and a replication of
the best-ﬁt model was attempted for the women’s data. EQS
Version 6.1 software was used (Bentler, 1995). The models were
tested using maximum likelihood.

different race moved next door’’ (.79) and ‘‘I wouldn’t mind
working with people from other races’’ (.76).
 Factor 3: social liberalism. Ten items had high (negative)
loadings on this factor. They included ‘‘Give law breakers
stiffer sentences’’ ( .63) and ‘‘Schools should teach children
to obey authority’’ ( .51).
 Factor 4: pro-working women. Six items had high (negative)
loadings on this factor. They included ‘‘Pre-school kids suffer
if mum works’’ ( .68) and ‘‘Family life suffers if mum is
working full-time’’ ( .70).
Cronbach alphas were .75 for political trust, .82 for antiracism,
.68 for social liberalism, and .65 for pro-working women. There
were signiﬁcant correlations among all four factors, with effect
sizes (r) ranging from .06 to .27.

Fig. 1. Structural equation model relating general cognitive ability (g) at age 10 to a latent trait of social attitudes (liberal, nontraditional social
attitudes) at age 30 in the British Cohort Survey 1970. Each path is shown with the standardized path coefﬁcients for men (left; n 5 3,412) and women
(right; n 5 3,658). Circles represent latent traits, and rectangles represent manifest (measured) variables. Dashed lines indicate that the path
coefﬁcients are nonsigniﬁcant. See the footnote to Table 1 for an explanation of how the variables were scored.

Model Fit
The ﬁnal model for men (Fig. 1) had only small changes from the
model stipulated a priori in the previous paragraph. The Lagrange Multiplier test indicated that the associations between
parental and the person’s own occupational social class and the
speciﬁc attitude scale indexing political trust should be added to
the model. Adding these signiﬁcantly improved ﬁt. The Lagrange Multiplier test suggested a signiﬁcant correlated residual
between pro-working-women and antiracism attitudes, which
was also added to the model. The Wald test indicated that the
paths from parental social class to the attitudes trait and from the
person’s own social class at age 30 to the attitudes trait were not
signiﬁcantly greater than zero. Because of their importance,
these paths were retained and tested again when the model was
ﬁtted to the women’s data.
In the ﬁnal model for men (Fig. 1), the average of the off-diagonal absolute standardized residuals was .026, and the largest
standardized residual was .077. The root-mean-square error of
approximation was .046. The chi square was 274.4 (df 5 33, p <
.001). The normed and nonnormed Bentler-Bonett ﬁt indices
were .962 and .944, respectively; the comparative ﬁt index was
.966; and the goodness-of-ﬁt index was .986. Therefore, the
model ﬁt well. The chi square was highly signiﬁcant, but this is
common with large samples. All paths were signiﬁcant, except
those between parental occupational social class and the latent
attitudes trait and between the person’s own occupational social
class at age 30 and the latent attitudes trait.
The women were used as a replication sample (Fig. 1). The
average of the off-diagonal absolute standardized residuals was

4

.022, and the largest standardized residual was .075. The rootmean-square error of approximation was .041. The chi square
was 238.0 (df 5 33, p < .001). The normed and nonnormed
Bentler-Bonett ﬁt indices were .968 and .954, respectively; the
comparative ﬁt index was .973; and the goodness-of-ﬁt index
was .988. The same model ﬁt the women’s data well. All paths
were signiﬁcant, except those between parental occupational
social class and the latent attitudes trait and between the
person’s own occupational social class at age 30 and the latent
attitudes trait.

Model Description
The model linking childhood intelligence and adult social
attitudes ﬁt the men’s and women’s data almost identically, and
the path coefﬁcients were almost identical. The measurement
models for the two latent traits were clearly supported. All four
mental tests loaded strongly on the latent factor of general intelligence (g). All four attitude scales loaded moderately and
signiﬁcantly on the latent attitude trait. Childhood g and parental occupational social class were moderately correlated.
The key ﬁnding was the strong association between higher g at
age 10 and generally more liberal, nontraditional social attitudes at age 30, even allowing for potential covariables. The
weight for this direct path was very similar in men (.46) and
women (.45). There was an additional, smaller indirect effect via
education. There were no signiﬁcant associations between g at
age 10 and scores for speciﬁc attitudes after the association with
general attitudes was taken into account.

Parental social class was signiﬁcantly associated with education and with the person’s own social class at age 30. General
intelligence (g) at age 10 and education were both signiﬁcantly
associated with the person’s own social class at age 30. There
were no signiﬁcant associations between parental social class or
the person’s own social class and the latent trait of social attitudes. There were signiﬁcant associations between parental
social class and political trust and between the person’s own
social class and political trust: People in more professional
occupations had greater trust.
DISCUSSION

In a large, prospectively studied, population-representative
sample, general mental ability at age 10 was strongly associated
with a latent trait underlying four domains of important social
attitudes at age 30. People with higher g scores in childhood
were, as adults, less likely to endorse traditional values across a
number of domains. The effect was not largely mediated by
educational qualiﬁcations, and was not at all mediated by a
person’s own occupational social class. There was a speciﬁc
effect of less political trust among people in more manual (bluecollar) occupations. Results were almost identical for men and
women.
This study conﬁrms cross-sectional ﬁndings that people with
higher intelligence are less likely to have traditional moral
values (Koenig & Bouchard, 2006; Saucier, 2000); these attitudes are also negatively correlated with the personality trait
openness to experience (Saucier, 2000), which is positively
correlated with intelligence (Gow, Whiteman, Pattie, & Deary,
2005). This study also accords with ﬁndings indicating that some
psychological constructs that were once thought to be noncognitive are associated with mental ability (Lykken, 1991; Sanders
et al., 1995). These include moral reasoning (Kohlberg, 1984;
Sanders et al., 1995), self-actualization (Maslow, 1971), and ego
development (Cohn & Westenberg, 2004; Loevinger, 1976,
1993). The decentering required for such social-moral developmental attainments, as well as the attitudes studied here,
might be caused by higher intelligence.
The idea that social attitudes and views are caused by reasoning processes was suggested by Scarr and Weinberg (1981).
McCourt et al. (1999) summarized their view: ‘‘Intelligence
drives attitude formation. That is, when considering social,
moral, and political situations, those with greater cognitive
skill are able to form more individualistic and open-minded
(i.e. antiauthoritarian) attitudes than those of lesser cognitive
ability’’ (p. 987, emphasis added). The association between intelligence and social attitudes might partly arise from genetic
inﬂuences that are common to them, perhaps via mediating
factors such as ‘‘mobility and learning’’ (Martin et al., 1986, p.
4368).
Alternative explanations of this association should be considered, however. First, note that people with higher ability tend

Volume 19—Number 1

to read more. If print media are more likely to be produced by
people who hold antitraditional views than by people who hold
traditional views, then there might be a causal path from intelligence to social views via cultural exposure. The present results
do not seem to support this explanation strongly, though, because education was not a particularly important mediator. Also,
individuals who produce print media might tend toward antitraditional views because of their own relatively high intelligence. Second, a noncausal explanation could be that people
with higher ability might have a more sophisticated view of
what attitudes are considered ‘‘acceptable’’ to researchers and
endorse these. One could test this possibility by examining
whether people with high mental ability not only endorse broadminded attitudes in research settings, but also behave in broadminded ways.
In this large, longitudinal study, intelligent children became,
on average, broad-minded adults. The state of mind common
to the attitude scales used in this analysis is one of objective
fairness to other individuals, an overturning of past prejudice
that militated against fairness. Brighter 10-year-olds are,
at age 30, more likely to hold to a ‘‘philosophy emphasising
reason and individualism rather than tradition,’’ which is how
The Concise Oxford Dictionary (Allen, 1990, p. 389) deﬁnes
enlightenment.
