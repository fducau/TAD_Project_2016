The Secret Life of Emotions

ABSTRACT—The possibility of unconsciously evoked emotions is often denied because awareness of an emotion’s
cause is considered to be precisely what produces the
emotion. However, we argue that because emotional responding is important for successful living, both global
and speciﬁc emotional responses can be induced without
awareness. The present research used quick and superquick subliminal priming techniques, and cognitive, feelings, and behavioral measures, to test this hypothesis. Our
results show that both global moods and speciﬁc emotions
can be evoked without conscious awareness of their cause.

Can people feel disgusted without consciously picturing the
rotten food that caused their disgust? Can they experience fear
without being consciously aware of the steep cliff that caused
their fear? An intuitive answer to these questions seems to be
‘‘no.’’ One might argue that speciﬁc emotions cannot be unconsciously elicited because emotions are always about something. One is sad about the loss of a good friend, angry with one’s
disrespectful boss, and disgusted at a bloody war picture.
Awareness of the cause of an emotion is often precisely what
produces the emotion (Parkinson & Manstead, 1992). Thus,
when you are hiking in the forest and suddenly ﬁnd yourself
standing face-to-face with a growling grizzly bear, it seems that
you need to be consciously aware of the bear to actually experience fear. You may feel aroused and tense, but for fear to be
induced you need to know why you feel that way (Barrett, 2005;
Clore, 1994; James, 1884; Schachter & Singer, 1962).
Interestingly, however, there is no clear empirical support for
the claim that a prerequisite for an emotion is awareness of what
caused it. In fact, taking a functional perspective (Cacioppo &
Gardner, 1999; Ekman, 1984; Frijda, 1988; Keltner & Gross,
1999; Öhman, 1992; Scherer, 1984)—emphasizing the universal and goal-directed nature of emotion—one could argue that it
should be possible for emotions to be unconsciously evoked.

Given that emotional responses are functional and thus help
people maneuver successfully through an ever-changing environment, it makes perfect sense that the emotional system is
designed to respond quickly and unconsciously to incoming
emotional stimuli. After all, you are likely to live longer if you
immediately stop moving at the sight of a growling grizzly bear
and do not need full awareness for such a response to be instigated. A classic functional perspective thus suggests that
emotions can indeed be elicited without conscious awareness.
Although emotion researchers acknowledged this point years
ago (Lazarus, 1991; Öhman, 1992; Winkielman & Berridge,
2004; Zajonc, 1980), empirical evidence for the existence of
unconsciously elicited emotions is scarce.
An essential element in modern emotion theories is the idea of
emotion speciﬁcity (Frijda, 1988; Keltner, Ellsworth, & Edwards,
1993; Lazarus, 1991; Scherer, 1984; Zeelenberg & Pieters,
2006). It is the speciﬁcity of emotions that distinguishes them
from (more global) moods and that allows for the differentiation
of emotions that have the same valence, such as anger, fear, and
disgust. It might seem that for a speciﬁc emotion (rather than a
global mood) to be elicited, speciﬁc stimulus information needs
to be encoded. For example, body-posture cues determine
whether an assailant evokes not simply negativity, but anger or
fear (Parkinson & Manstead, 1992). Can unconscious processing
be sufﬁciently speciﬁc that it might elicit ﬁne-grained emotional
responses?
Neuroimaging and physiological studies suggest an afﬁrmative answer to this question. Speciﬁc brain-activation patterns
are observed when participants are unconsciously exposed to
disgusted, fearful, sad, angry, and happy facial expressions
(Morris, De Gelder, Weiskrantz, & Dolan, 2001; Philips et al.,
2004). On a physiological level, unconscious exposure to happy
facial expressions and unconscious exposure to angry facial
expressions evoke distinctive electromyographic reactions in
emotion-relevant facial muscles (Dimberg, Thunberg, & Elmehed, 2000). This indicates that people tend to mimic unconsciously processed facial emotional expressions. However,
this ﬁnding cannot be taken to mean that mimickers experience
the emotion associated with the expression. These studies do
strongly suggest that the human brain is capable of discriminating among speciﬁc, unconsciously processed emotional stimuli. However, given the special nature of facial emotional ex-

pressions (see Hariri, Tessitore, Mattay, Fera, & Weinberger,
2002; Kimura, Yoshino, Takahashi, & Nomura, 2004), it is an
empirical question whether these ﬁndings generalize to other
types of emotional stimuli, such as mad, growling dogs or dirty,
unﬂushed toilets. Moreover, there is a crucial difference between discriminating among speciﬁc emotional stimuli and
being emotionally affected by these stimuli (Lambie & Marcel,
2002). Thus, the empirical question whether unconscious exposure to emotional stimuli elicits the experience of speciﬁc
emotions and speciﬁc emotional behavior still remains.
Even though the question whether it is possible for unconscious processing to result in speciﬁc emotional feelings has
yet to be answered, global unconscious affective processing
is relatively well documented. There is strong support for the
notion that people can discriminate between globally positive
and negative stimuli that are presented outside conscious
awareness (Bargh, Litt, Pratto, & Spielman, 1989; Murphy &
Zajonc, 1993; Stapel, Koomen, & Ruys, 2002; Winkielman
& Berridge, 2004; Zajonc, 1980). The existence of such quick
and unconscious positive-negative processing is typically explained using an evolutionary perspective. Such processing is
essential to survival of a species because it helps to differentiate
between hospitable (good) and hostile (bad) stimuli. The human
brain and body have been shaped by natural selection to perform
global affective categorizations quickly and effectively, and to
respond accordingly (Hunt & Campbell, 1997).
The question is, however, whether quick and automatic detection that something is positive or negative is enough for adequate response to stimuli and events in the world. Is the knowledge that something is positive or negative enough for the
organism to prepare for proper action? We think not. We argue
that because speciﬁc emotions are essential to effective living,
quick, unconscious detection of speciﬁc emotional information
should be possible. It is important to be able to automatically
detect both the valence of a stimulus and its speciﬁc meaning in
order to respond quickly and properly to it. It is crucial to know
that something is ‘‘disgusting’’ and not ‘‘scary.’’ Knowing that
something is ‘‘negative’’ does not sufﬁce.
The fact that global positive-negative classiﬁcations of stimuli
occur quickly and unconsciously should not be taken to mean
that more speciﬁc and ﬁne-grained processing of emotional information cannot occur unconsciously (as some researchers
have argued—Bargh, 1997; Barrett, 2005; Zajonc, 1980). Quite
the opposite: Emotion induction is likely to occur quickly and
unconsciously because that is functional for successful living
(see also Ekman, 1984; Izard, 1977; Plutchik, 1994). Even
though the processing of stimuli in the environment unfolds from
the global to the local level (i.e., microgenesis; see Rosenthal,
2004; Werner, 1956), it may proceed without the need for conscious awareness.
Indeed, there is empirical evidence that both global, valencebased reactions and speciﬁc, ﬁne-grained responses may occur
without conscious awareness (e.g., Stapel & Koomen, 2005;

Stapel et al., 2002). Consistent with the idea that information
processing unfolds from the global to the speciﬁc are ﬁndings
that global evaluative reactions to stimuli are typically triggered
earlier than speciﬁc descriptive reactions. In previous work
(Stapel et al., 2002), we showed that super-quick subliminal
exposure to, for example, a smiling female face resulted in
global, valence-based reactions (‘‘happy’’), whereas quick subliminal exposure resulted in speciﬁc, descriptive reactions
(‘‘woman’’). Studies using words as primes showed a similar
pattern of results (e.g., Stapel & Koomen, 2005): Super-quick
subliminal exposure to, for example, the word conﬁdent led to
global, valence-based reactions (‘‘positive’’), whereas quick
subliminal exposure to this word led to speciﬁc, descriptive
reactions (‘‘conﬁdent’’). In sum, these studies demonstrate that
valence-based reactions generally are initiated before more
ﬁne-grained reactions, and that both types of reactions can occur
without awareness.
Given that ﬁne-grained processing of emotion cues (is it scary
or disgusting?) is likely to take somewhat longer than global,
valence-based processing (is it positive or negative?), and given
that it is functional for both types of processing to occur unconsciously, we hypothesized that the induction of speciﬁc
emotions can be quick and unconscious, notwithstanding the
even quicker induction of global affect. Consequently, we predicted that when unconscious exposure to an emotion-eliciting
stimulus is quick, the stimulus will evoke the corresponding
speciﬁc emotional experience. We also predicted that when
unconscious exposure to an emotion-eliciting stimulus is superquick, the stimulus will evoke primarily global positive or negative feelings.
To test our model of the unconscious genesis of emotional
processing, we conducted two studies in which we subliminally
primed people with emotion-eliciting stimuli. We selected blackand-white emotion-eliciting primes from the International
Affective Picture System (IAPS) to elicit fear, disgust, or no emotion. Taking a multicomponent perspective on emotion (Frijda,
1988; Scherer, 1984), we then measured participants’ moods
and emotions with cognitive, feelings, and behavioral measures.
We expected that super-quick subliminal priming would induce
a global mood (Isen, 1984; Niedenthal & Showers, 1991),
whereas quick subliminal priming would also elicit the relevant
emotion.

STUDY 1

Method
Participants and Design
Undergraduates (N 5 90) participated in Study 1 for partial
course credit. They were randomly assigned to the conditions of
a 2 (prime exposure: quick, super-quick)  3 (prime emotion:
disgust, fear, no emotion) between-participants design.

Feelings Measures. Next, participants completed the feelings
measures, which consisted of a general mood question and eight
speciﬁc emotion scales. Participants indicated their mood on a
7-point scale ranging from negative (1) to positive (7). (Responses
were reverse-coded for data analysis.) Then, participants indicated the extent to which they felt fearful, disgusted, satisﬁed,
relieved, proud, angry, shameful, and joyful, using 5-point
scales ranging from absolutely not (1) to absolutely yes (5).

Procedure and Measures
Upon arrival, participants were shown into one of eight cubicles
and seated in front of a computer. They were then told that they
would be involved in a series of unrelated studies.
Priming. First, participants performed a parafoveal vigilance
task (Bargh & Pietromonaco, 1982; Stapel et al., 2002) in which
emotion-eliciting stimuli were presented outside awareness.
Participants were told that very short ﬂashes (actually, the
priming stimuli) would appear on the screen at unpredictable
places and times and that their task was to decide as quickly and
accurately as possible whether each ﬂash appeared on the left
or right side of the screen. The experimenter instructed participants to place their index ﬁngers on two keys of the keyboard
and to press the left key, labeled ‘‘L,’’ if a ﬂash appeared on the
left side of the screen and the right key, labeled ‘‘R,’’ if a ﬂash
appeared on the right side of the screen. A ﬁxation point consisting of one ‘‘X’’ was presented continually in the center of the
screen.
Participants were seated so that the distance between their
eyes and the computer screen was 80 to 100 cm. This ensured
that the priming stimuli were presented outside of participants’
perceptual ﬁelds. The priming stimuli were black-and-white
emotion-eliciting pictures taken from the IAPS. They were selected to elicit fear (e.g., a growling, mad dog), disgust (e.g., a
dirty, unﬂushed toilet), or no emotion (e.g., a horse); the fear and
disgust primes were pretested to ensure that each elicited the
appropriate emotion and no other emotions when presented
supraliminally.
Participants were given 10 practice trials to become familiar
with the procedure. The pictures ﬂashed during these trials were
of neutral stimuli (e.g., a chair). After answering any questions,
the experimenter began the 60 experimental trials, 40 with
neutral stimuli and 20 with priming stimuli. The order in which
these stimuli were ﬂashed was random. In the quick condition,
pictures were ﬂashed for 120 ms. In the super-quick condition,
pictures were ﬂashed for 40 ms. Each picture was immediately
followed by a 120-ms mask, which was a gray square (consisting
of black and white dots) the same size as the primes. Completing
the task took approximately 10 min.

Behavioral Measure. The behavioral measure that followed
consisted of the choice to take part in a ‘‘strange food test’’ or in a
‘‘scary movie test.’’ We expected that fearful participants would
choose the strange-food test to avoid more fear-eliciting materials, whereas disgusted participants would choose the scarymovie test to avoid exposure to food.

Cognitive Measures. After the vigilance task, participants were
given a word-completion task consisting of 18 word fragments
that could be completed as disgust words, fear words, anger
words, general negative words, general positive words, and
neutral words (3 per category). For each category of fragments,
we counted the number of completed words that were related to
the intended category. Feeling a speciﬁc emotion should result
in an increased tendency to complete word fragments as words
related to that emotion (e.g., disgusted participants should be
more likely than others to complete fragments as disgust words),
whereas experiencing a negative mood should result in completing more fragments as general negative words than as positive or neutral words.

Debrieﬁng. Previous subliminal priming studies had shown that
the paradigm we employed provides sufﬁcient safeguards to
prevent participants from becoming aware of the priming stimuli
(see Chartrand & Bargh, 1996; Erdley & D’Agostino, 1988;
Stapel et al., 2002). However, to ensure that this was the case, we
included an extensive funneled debrieﬁng procedure at the end
of the study. During the debrieﬁng, participants were asked
increasingly speciﬁc questions (see Stapel et al., 2002) probing
their awareness of the priming stimuli, their awareness of the
inﬂuence of the priming task on later judgments, and their
general suspicion concerning the goal of the study. This procedure demonstrated that none of the participants were aware of
the content of the priming stimuli.
Pretest. A pretest indicated that after conscious exposure to the
emotion-eliciting primes, participants responded as expected on
the word-completion, feelings, general-mood, and choice measures.

Results and Discussion
Tables 1 through 3 present results for the cognitive, feelings, and
behavioral measures.1 We conducted 3 (prime emotion: disgust,
fear, no emotion)  2 (prime exposure: quick, super-quick)
analyses of variance on our cognitive and feelings measures and
found the expected speciﬁc-emotion effects when the emotioneliciting primes were ﬂashed quickly, but not when they were
ﬂashed super-quickly. Speciﬁcally, the predicted interaction of
prime emotion and prime exposure was found for completion of
both disgust-related word fragments, F(2, 84) 5 5.51, prep 5 .96,
Z2 5 .12, and fear-related word fragments, F(2, 84) 5 4.45,
prep 5 .94, Z2 5 .10. This interaction was also found for subjective ratings of disgust, F(2, 84) 5 3.96, prep 5 .92, Z2 5 .09,
and fearfulness, F(2, 84) 5 8.90, prep 5 1.00, Z2 5 .18. Participants completed more word fragments as disgust-related
words and reported feeling more disgusted after quick exposures

completed more word fragments as fear-related words and reported feeling more fearful after quick exposures to fearful

To test our hypothesis with the choice measure, we performed
Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests for the quick and the superquick exposure conditions separately. These analyses showed
that participants chose to continue with the scary-movie test
more frequently when disgusting stimuli were ﬂashed quickly
than when fearful stimuli were ﬂashed quickly, w2(1, N 5 90) 5
4.66, prep 5 .91. When stimuli were ﬂashed super-quickly, the
choice measure showed no signiﬁcant difference among the
prime-emotion conditions (w2 < 1).
The results show that emotional experience and behavior can
be elicited in a person who is not consciously aware of their
cause. However, the measures were completed in a ﬁxed order,
and one could argue that responses on the cognitive measure
might have inﬂuenced responses on the feelings and behavioral
measures. We deem this alternative explanation unlikely for two
reasons: First, Innes-Ker and Niedenthal (2002) have shown
that semantic activation of emotion knowledge is not enough to
elicit the subjective feelings associated with a full-blown emotion. Second, we think that semantic activation of the emotions
should have led to the opposite pattern of results for our behavioral measure. Semantic activation of fear should have led
participants in the fear condition to choose the scary-movie test
more often than the strange-food test. However, as expected, our
ﬁndings showed the opposite pattern: Quick exposure to feareliciting stimuli caused participants to choose the strange-food
test more often than the scary-movie test. Nevertheless, we resolved the order confound in Study 2.

Method
Undergraduates (N 5 90) participated in Study 2 for course
credit. The design and priming procedure were identical to those
of Study 1. Our dependent measures were similar to those of
Study 1 except that we used an alternative cognitive measure
and counterbalanced the order of this measure and the feelings
measures. Also, participants indicated their general mood on a
9-point scale ranging from negative (1) to positive (9), instead of
on a 7-point scale, as in Study 1.
The alternative cognitive measure consisted of six emotionspeciﬁc scenarios, three fear scenarios and three disgust scenarios. For example, in one of the fear scenarios, participants

Volume 19—Number 4

Kirsten I. Ruys and Diederik A. Stapel

imagined walking on the street at night and noticing that a
suspicious person was moving toward them. They then indicated
the likelihood that they would cross the street. We expected that
scared participants would be more likely than participants who
did not feel scared to interpret the situation as fearful and
therefore to indicate that they would cross the street. In one of
the disgust scenarios, participants indicated the extent to which
they would be willing to shake the hand of someone who just
blew his or her nose. We expected that disgusted participants
would be more likely than other participants to interpret the
situation as disgusting and therefore to be less likely to indicate
that they would shake this person’s hand. Participants read the
scenarios in a mixed order. In each case, participants indicated
the likelihood that they would perform the suggested action,
using a 9-point scale from very unlikely (1) to highly likely (9).
For the analyses, the scores on each scenario were recoded such
that a high score represented a high likelihood to interpret the
scenario in terms of the intended emotion.
Results
Tables 4 through 6 present results for the cognitive, feelings, and

analyses of variance on our cognitive and feelings measures and

tral stimuli (all preps > .88). Furthermore, participants were
more likely to interpret the fear scenarios in terms of fear and
reported feeling more fearful after quick exposures to fearful
stimuli than after quick exposures to disgusting or neutral
stimuli (all preps > .88). However, when exposures were superquick, the scenario measures and the emotion-speciﬁc subjective ratings revealed no speciﬁc-emotion effects (all Fs < 1).
As predicted, general mood effects appeared after both quick
and super-quick exposures to disgusting and fearful stimuli:
Participants interpreted the scenarios slightly more negatively
and reported feeling more negative in the disgust and fear
conditions than in the no-emotion condition, F(2, 84) 5 11.10,
prep 5 1.00, Z2 5 .21. As expected, in both exposure conditions,
the irrelevant emotion-speciﬁc scales showed no signiﬁcant
effects (all Fs < 1).
To test our hypothesis with the choice measure, we performed
Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests for the quick and the superquick exposure conditions separately. These analyses showed
that participants chose to continue with the scary-movie test
more frequently when disgusting stimuli were ﬂashed quickly
than when fearful stimuli were ﬂashed quickly, w2(1, N 5 90) 5

was no signiﬁcant difference among the prime-emotion conditions (w2 < 1).

Secret Life of Emotions

GENERAL DISCUSSION

The results of two studies strongly support the hypothesis that
speciﬁc emotions can be elicited without conscious awareness of
their cause. Quick, unconscious exposures to emotion-eliciting
pictures resulted in emotion-speciﬁc effects on cognitive, feelings, and behavioral measures. Speciﬁcally, disgusting pictures
increased cognitive accessibility of disgust words and feelings of
disgust. Similarly, fearful pictures increased cognitive accessibility of fear words and feelings of fear. Notably, our choice
measure showed the pattern opposite to what would be expected
on the basis of cognitive accessibility: Quick exposure to feareliciting stimuli caused participants to choose to test potentially
disgusting food, whereas quick exposure to disgust-eliciting
stimuli caused participants to choose to watch scary movies.
When exposure to the priming stimuli was super-quick, global
mood, rather than a speciﬁc emotion, was evoked. These ﬁndings
are the ﬁrst to empirically demonstrate (a) that speciﬁc emotions
can be evoked without conscious awareness of their cause, (b)
that unconscious exposure to emotion-eliciting pictures can
evoke the speciﬁc corresponding emotion and does not evoke
other emotions of similar valence, and (c) that unconscious
emotion induction develops from elicitation of global affect to
elicitation of speciﬁc emotions.
How do our ﬁndings relate to the current debate on unconscious emotions? Although most researchers deny the existence
of unconscious emotions (Barrett, 2005; Clore, 1994), other
researchers see unconscious emotions as likely (Winkielman &
Berridge, 2004). Emotions might be viewed as unconscious
when they are detected by indirect behavioral or physiological
measures, without being accompanied by conscious emotional
experience. However, what does it mean when only indirect
measures suggest the presence of an emotion? We think that the
range of emotional measures that are affected depends on an
emotion’s intensity. When emotions are full-blown, people become aware of their emotions by perceiving their own actions
and bodily reactions. When emotions are weak, people fail to
notice their weakly related actions and bodily reactions. The
current research was not designed to investigate this issue.
Rather, this research shows that the cause of emotional experience and behavior can be unconscious. Thus, emotions can
lead secret lives in the sense that emotions can be elicited unconsciously.
In this research, we induced the speciﬁc emotions of fear and
disgust. We selected these emotions because they are of the
same valence but differ with respect to the speciﬁc cognitions,
feelings, and behaviors that they elicit. This design allowed us to
emphasize our main point: that speciﬁc emotions can be elicited
unconsciously. One could argue that we should have included
speciﬁc positive emotions to make our case. Indeed, positive
emotions are functional and important for survival. However,
positive emotions, such as joy and happiness, are less speciﬁc
and inherently more valence based than negative emotions

positive emotions were included in the present studies.
Our ﬁndings clearly illustrate how an affective response may
unfold unconsciously over time, developing from a global, valence-based mood to a speciﬁc, meaning-based emotion. On a
general level, our ﬁndings explain how it is possible that people
sometimes experience a speciﬁc emotion without immediately
knowing why.
