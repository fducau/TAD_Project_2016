ABSTRACT—Subjective

well-being is known to be related to
personality traits. However, to date, nobody has examined
whether personality and subjective well-being share a
common genetic structure. We used a representative sample of 973 twin pairs to test the hypothesis that heritable
differences in subjective well-being are entirely accounted
for by the genetic architecture of the Five-Factor Model’s
personality domains. Results supported this model. Subjective well-being was accounted for by unique genetic
inﬂuences from Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness, and by a common genetic factor that inﬂuenced all ﬁve personality domains in the directions of low
Neuroticism and high Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. These ﬁndings indicate
that subjective well-being is linked to personality by common genes and that personality may form an ‘‘affective
reserve’’ relevant to set-point maintenance and changes in
set point over time.

Across cultures, people rate subjective well-being as the most
important element of their life and more important than material
success (Diener, 2000). Subjective well-being is associated with
numerous positive outcomes, including, for example, good work
performance and health (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999).
Moreover, subjective well-being appears not only to track life
events, but also to play a causal role in the achievement of

positive outcomes (Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005). Currently, the origins of this important construct are only just beginning to be understood, and there is a need for further research
to investigate its determinants.
Numerous studies have shown that subjective well-being is
related to the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality, especially the domains of Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness, and that, although subjective well-being is not
subsumed by personality, the two constructs are reliably correlated (DeNeve & Cooper, 1998). At a psychological level,
several plausible mechanisms have been proposed to explain
the relationship between personality and subjective well-being.
For example, some researchers (Cantor & Sanderson, 1999;
Carver & Scheier, 1990) have emphasized the roles of Extraversion and Neuroticism in reward and punishment systems,
respectively. Others have proposed that the relationship arises
from indirect, instrumental effects of personality on the experiences an individual encounters (McCrae & Costa, 1991).
Major life events, as well as political and economic factors,
are also related to subjective well-being; however, the effects of
these factors leave much of the variance in subjective well-being
unexplained (see Diener, Lucas, & Scollon, 2006, for a review).
Findings from numerous studies of personality show that genetic
effects account for approximately 50% of the variance in the
FFM domains (Bouchard & Loehlin, 2001), and variance in
subjective well-being also appears to be moderately heritable.
In a seminal twin study using the Well-Being scale of the Multiphasic Personality Questionnaire, Lykken and Tellegen (1996)
found that approximately half of the variance in well-being resulted from nonadditive Gene  Gene interaction effects, and
that common environmental effects shared by twins did not lead
to more similar levels of happiness. Similarly, Nes, Rysamb,
Tambs, Harris, and Reichborn-Kjennerud (2006) found that

approximately 50% of the variance in subjective well-being and
80% of the cross-time correlation were accounted for by genetic
effects. This study, however, found evidence for additive rather
than nonadditive genetic effects. These studies of personality
and subjective well-being yielded evidence for only small effects of the shared environment. However, as environmental
effects ‘‘transact’’ with genetic differences, leading to complex
effects that are not apparent in the main (average) effects
(Johnson, 2007), the studies’ estimates of environmental effects
are probably conservative.
As we have noted, several psychological connections between
subjective well-being and personality have been postulated.
One possible explanation for the correlation between personality and subjective well-being that has not been explored is
that, as is the case with Neuroticism and depression (Kendler,
Gardner, Gatz, & Pedersen, 2007; Kendler, Gatz, Gardner, &
Pedersen, 2006), personality and subjective well-being may be
correlated because they share genes. In the study reported here,
we tested this hypothesis in a large representative sample of
adult twins in the United States. We hypothesized that the heritable component of subjective well-being is entirely explained
by the genetic architecture of the FFM. If supported, this
hypothesis would provide important insights for theories of
subjective well-being, suggesting that the genetic and environmental models of subjective well-being may be framed in
terms of personality.
METHOD

Participants
The sample consisted of twin pairs from the MacArthur Foundation Survey of Midlife Development in the United States
(MIDUS). Approximately 50,000 households, representative of
the population of the United States, were initially screened by
telephone. Just under 15% of respondents reported having twins
in the family, and 60% of this group gave permission for the
twins to be contacted as part of the MIDUS recruitment process
(Kendler, Thornton, Gilman, & Kessler, 2000; Kessler, Gilman,
Thornton, & Kendler, 2004). Zygosity was determined using selfreport questions (e.g., similarity of eye and hair color, similarity
in childhood as indicated by misidentiﬁcation). Previous studies
have indicated that these measures have greater than 90%
accuracy in identifying the zygosity of twin pairs (Lykken,
Bouchard, McGue, & Tellegen, 1990).
Inclusion criteria included being ﬁrst-degree relatives of the
original contact or the contact’s partner, being between 25 and
74 years old at the time of recruitment, living in the continental
United States, being reachable by telephone, and being able to
speak English. The resultant twin sample consisted of 973 twin
pairs (365 monozygotic and 608 dizygotic) with a mean age of
44.9 (SD 5 12.1). Personality or well-being data were available
for at least one twin in each pair. Of the monozygotic pairs, 171
were male (mean age 5 44.5, SD 5 11.5) and 194 were female

206

(mean age 5 43.5, SD 5 12.2). Of the dizygotic pairs, 136 were
male (mean age 5 44.2, SD 5 12.5), 213 were female (mean age
5 45.9, SD 5 12.4), and 259 were opposite sex (mean age 5
45.8, SD 5 11.9). Subjective well-being data were available for
both members of the pair for 347 monozygotic pairs and 543
dizygotic pairs, and personality data were available for both
members of 314 monozygotic pairs and 471 (Openness) to 473
(Agreeableness and Conscientiousness) dizygotic pairs. In the
analyses, information from all 973 twin pairs was used (Neale &
Cardon, 1992).
Measures
Personality
The Midlife Development Inventory (MIDI), a self-administered
25-item personality questionnaire (Lachman & Weaver, 1997),
was mailed to each participant. Respondents used 4-point
Likert scales to indicate the degree to which each adjective on
the questionnaire described them. Our measures of personality
were scores on the ﬁve previously deﬁned MIDI scales (Lachman & Weaver, 1997). Each score was calculated by obtaining
the average of the ratings for items deﬁning that dimension:
Neuroticism was deﬁned by moody, worrying, nervous, and calm
(reverse-scored); Extraversion was deﬁned by outgoing,
friendly, lively, active, and talkative; Openness to Experience
was deﬁned by creative, imaginative, intelligent, curious, broadminded, sophisticated, and adventurous; Agreeableness was deﬁned by helpful, caring, warm, soft-hearted, and sympathetic;
and Conscientiousness was deﬁned by organized, responsible,
hardworking, and careless (reverse-scored).
Subjective Well-Being
We assessed subjective well-being using three questions that
were administered by telephone interview. These questions were
similar to those used in other studies (see, e.g., Diener et al.,
1999). The ﬁrst question asked how satisﬁed participants were
with life at the present, the second asked how much control
subjects felt they had over their lives, and the third asked how
satisﬁed they were with life overall. Each question was answered
using a 4-point Likert scale, with lower values indicating higher
subjective well-being. For the purpose of the present study, we
reverse-coded and summed each participant’s responses.
Analysis
A classical twin design, in which the resemblance of monozygotic and dizygotic twins is compared, was used. On the basis
of previous ﬁndings suggesting the presence of nonadditive
genetic effects and the lack of shared environmental effects
(Lykken & Tellegen, 1996), we used structural equation modeling to model the covariance of identical twins in terms of
additive (A) and nonadditive dominance (D) genetic effects. The
covariance of nonidentical twins was speciﬁed as 12 A 1 14 D.

Unshared effects were modeled as unique environment (E).
These models were estimated by maximum likelihood in Mx
(Neale, Boker, Xie, & Maes, 1999).
To test our hypothesis that genetic variance in subjective wellbeing stems from the genetics of personality, we used a multivariate Cholesky decomposition of additive genetic, dominance
genetic, and unique environmental covariance between the
measures. The Cholesky form speciﬁes as many factors as there
are variables (sources of variance), each factor having one less
loading than the previous one. The ﬁt of theoretical models can
be tested by comparing their ﬁt with that of the saturated model.
A reduced model (i.e., one with fewer parameters) is favored if
the likelihood-ratio chi-square comparing the reduced model
with the saturated model (or a model in which the reduced model
is nested) is less than the critical value (a 5 .05) of the chisquare distribution, which indicates that there is no signiﬁcant
difference between models. We predicted that we could drop the
latent genetic factor speciﬁc to subjective well-being without a
signiﬁcant loss of ﬁt.
RESULTS

The phenotypic correlations of subjective well-being and Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness were .35, .29, .14, .16, and .21,
respectively, and thus consistent with previous ﬁndings (DeNeve & Cooper, 1998). Table 1 shows the mean scores and
standard deviations for the personality domains and subjective
well-being, as well as the correlations between co-twins. The
correlations for monozygotic twins were substantially greater
than those for dizygotic twins, which is consistent with prior
ﬁndings suggesting that subjective well-being has a nonadditive
genetic component and that there is little evidence for shared
environmental effects (Lykken & Tellegen, 1996). The substantially greater monozygotic-twin correlations support the
inclusion of genetic dominance rather than shared environmental effects in the base model.
Testing for bivariate normality using the %P function in Mx
(z < 3.5 or > 3.5) identiﬁed 8 twin pairs that were outliers. We

therefore excluded these twin pairs from the analysis. We
also controlled for gender and age, as males had signiﬁcantly
lower mean levels of Neuroticism (b 5 0.11, p < .05),
Agreeableness (b 5 0.24, p < .05), and Conscientiousness
(b 5 0.10, p < .05) than females, and older participants had
lower levels of Neuroticism (b 5 .15, p < .05) and Openness
(b 5 .09, p < .05) than females, and higher scores for
Agreeableness (b 5 .05, p < .05) and subjective well-being
(b 5 .13, p < .05).
The hypothesized model speciﬁed that all genetic inﬂuences
on subjective well-being originated from a general genetic factor
that also inﬂuenced the ﬁve personality domains and from
genetic factors for the ﬁve personality domains. The model, then,
posited general latent additive and dominance genetic effects
underlying variance in all ﬁve personality domains and subjective well-being and also included speciﬁc additive and
dominance genetic effects for the ﬁve personality domains,
which also contributed to variance in subjective well-being (as
shown for additive effects in Fig. 1).
There was no signiﬁcant difference in ﬁt between the hypothesized model and the saturated model, Dw2(10) 5 5.69,
p > .05, Akaike information criterion (AIC) 5 14.31. Next, we
performed a powerful test with a single degree of freedom to
compare the ﬁt of the hypothesized model with that of a model
having additional genetic factors speciﬁc to subjective wellbeing. Dropping either the additive or the dominance factor led
to no change in log likelihood, p 5 1.00. This result is consistent
with there being no speciﬁc genetic effects on subjective wellbeing independent of the genetic effects on personality.
The hypothesized model was then further reduced by removing genetic paths from the Agreeableness and Openness
domains to subjective well-being. The model with these paths
eliminated did not differ signiﬁcantly from the originally
hypothesized model, Dw2(4) 5 1.79, p > .05, AIC 5 20.52. In
a ﬁnal model, we tested whether the dominance effects were
signiﬁcant; eliminating these effects did not signiﬁcantly reduce
model ﬁt, Dw2(14) 5 19.99, p > .05, AIC 5 28.52. The ﬁnal
model included a general additive genetic factor that contributed to variance in all ﬁve personality domains and subjective

DISCUSSION

These results show that the genetic structure of the FFM and
subjective well-being can be modeled without genetic inﬂuences speciﬁc to subjective well-being. That is, there were no
genetic effects unique to subjective well-being. Instead, these
ﬁndings show that the genetic variance underlying individual
differences in happiness is also responsible for individual differences in Neuroticism, Extraversion, and, to a lesser extent,
Conscientiousness. We also found evidence for a general genetic
factor underlying individual differences in the FFM domains
and subjective well-being.
In this sample, it was possible to drop the dominance effects
without signiﬁcantly reducing ﬁt. This result is consistent with
some (Nes et al., 2006), but by no means all (Lykken & Tellegen,
1996), ﬁndings. One reason for the disparate ﬁndings concerning dominance effects on subjective well-being is that classical
twin designs have low power to detect dominance effects (Neale
& Cardon, 1992). Thus, an extended twin design or larger
sample would be needed to deﬁnitively address the question of
whether dominance or something like dizygotic sibling-contrast
effects (Eaves & Silberg, 2005) are responsible for the fact that
co-twin correlations for subjective well-being are substantially
higher for monozygotic than for dizygotic twin pairs.
The most important ﬁnding of this study is that subjective
well-being was genetically indistinct from personality traits,
especially those reﬂecting, in part, emotional stability (low
Neuroticism), social and physical activity (high Extraversion),
and constraint (high Conscientiousness). The close genetic
relationship between positive personality traits and happiness
traits is the mirror image of comorbidity in psychopathology
(Kendler et al., 2006, 2007). Weiss, King, and Enns (2002)
coined the term ‘‘covitality’’ to describe the genetic correlation
between a personality domain, Dominance, and subjective wellbeing in chimpanzees.
One unexpected ﬁnding of this study is that we found evidence
for a single genetic effect that contributed to variance in all ﬁve
personality domains and to subjective well-being. The presence
of this general genetic factor suggests that a higher-order factor,
perhaps reﬂecting life-history strategy (Figueredo, Vásquez,
Brumbach, & Schneider, 2004, 2007), is reﬂected in subjective
well-being and personality. However, because our study did not
include multiple methods (see, e.g., Riemann, Angleitner, &
Strelau, 1997), it is impossible to rule out the possibility that the
general genetic factor reﬂects common-method variance or a heritable tendency toward positive self-presentation.
The present ﬁndings suggest that the relationship between
subjective well-being and a range of health and social-relationship factors may also be mediated by common genetic effects. In
future twin studies, researchers may wish to examine the relationships between subjective well-being and factors such as
marital stability, social support, and religious attendance
(Myers, 2000), controlling for personality, preferably at a behav-

Volume 19—Number 3

ior-genetic level. Such studies could determine whether these
relationships are also moderated by common genetic effects.
Our ﬁndings also have implications for the set-point theory of
subjective well-being. Recent results have revealed not only
that there are individual differences in the subjective well-being
set point, but also that environmental events can lead to lasting
changes in this set point and that the degree of adaptation to
circumstances differs among individuals (Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, & Diener, 2003; Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, & Diener,
2004). The present results suggest that genetic effects of personality may affect the rate at which well-being returns to the set
point after a disturbance, and the extent to which the set point
undergoes lasting change in response to environmental events.
Thus, personality may create what might be termed an affective
reserve, which can be called upon in times of stress and recovery.
These ﬁndings have major implications for studies on the
molecular genetics of subjective well-being and other positive
psychological traits. To the extent that resilience and the ability
to capitalize on positive environmental inputs are related to the
same genetic factors that inﬂuence personality, geneticists interested in subjective well-being should focus their search for
genes on those genes that inﬂuence personality and attempt to
understand how speciﬁc combinations of those genes, possibly
in certain environments, contribute to the human experience of
happiness.
