# TAD_Project_2016
Text as Data final project. 

In this project we analyze if it is possible to determine if a scientific publication contains
within its text some information about its replicability. Our hypothesis is that there is sufficient
information embedded in the body of a published paper to recognize if the reported results
are reproducible or not. Our question is, do scientist write in a different way when they are
presenting flawed or false results? The way the results are presented, the language used and the
level of obfuscation when presenting results might lead us to determine the reproducibility of
the research.

Results and description are in the file TAD_Final_Project.pdf
