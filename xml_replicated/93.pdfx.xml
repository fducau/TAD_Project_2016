      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="5" confidence="possible">A model of risk regulation is proposed to explain how low and high self-esteem people balance the tension between self-protection and connectedness goals in romantic relationships. This model assumes that interpersonal risk automatically activates connectedness and self-protection goals. The activation of these competing goals then triggers an executive control system that resolves this goal conflict. One correlational study and 8 experiments manipulating risk, goal strength, and executive strength and then measuring implicit and explicit goal activation and execution strongly supported the model. For people high in self-esteem, risk triggers a control system that directs them toward the situations of dependence within their relationship that can fulfill connectedness goals. For people low in self-esteem, however, the activation of connectedness goals triggers a control system that prioritizes self-protection goals and directs them away from situations where they need to trust or depend on their partner.

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="10" page="1" column="1">Simon’s observation that love requires taking risks aptly captures a basic approach–avoidance conflict in interpersonal life. Risking thoughts and behaviors that increase closeness necessarily increases both the likelihood and pain of rejection (Murray, Holmes, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="7" class="deo:Reference">Collins, 2006</xref>). Consequently, to satisfy connectedness goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="8" class="deo:Reference">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>), people need to compromise self-protection concerns. Perhaps nowhere is this conflict more poignant than in people’s romantic relationships. Imagine that Sally has a bad day at work and comes to her husband Harry for consolation. Her willingness to increase dependence by seeking Harry’s support is critical for foster- ing a satisfying connection to Harry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="9" class="deo:Reference">Collins &amp; Feeney, 2000</xref>), but in seeking Harry’s support, she also risks his criticism or rebuff. Moreover, the pain of rejection and relationship loss only increases the more Sally comes to depend on Harry for comfort.</region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="22" page="1" column="2">To satisfy self-protection concerns, Sally should be motivated to think and behave in ways that limit her dependence on Harry’s actions in the short term and diminish the long-term potential pain of relationship loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="14" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2006</xref>). However, to meet basic goals for a close, satisfying connection with Harry, she needs to risk substantial dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48" id="15" class="deo:Reference">Kelley, 1979</xref>). People in satisfying relationships routinely enter into situations that give a partner considerable power over their outcomes and think in ways that invest great importance in the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34" id="16" class="deo:Reference">Gagne &amp; Lydon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62" id="17" class="deo:Reference">Murray, 1999</xref>). For instance, they respond to the partner’s needs as they arise and, trustingly, leave the timing of repayment open-ended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="18" class="deo:Reference">Clark &amp; Grote, 1998</xref>). They also overlook or excuse their partner’s transgressions, risking the chance of similar misdeeds and hurts in the future (Rusbult, Verette, Whitney, Slovik, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76" id="19" class="deo:Reference">Lipkus, 1991</xref>). To effectively negotiate interpersonal life, people need a regulatory system in place to balance the tension between connectedness and self-protection goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="20" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2006</xref>). This article presents one correlational and eight experimental studies illustrating how this risk regulation system operates in romantic relationships for people who are differentially sensitive to rejection— specifically, people relatively low versus high in self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50" id="21" class="deo:Reference">Leary &amp; Baumeister, 2000</xref>). We hope to demonstrate that interpersonal risk automatically activates the goals of seeking connection and avoiding rejection. This goal conflict then triggers a corrective, executive control system— one that typically interferes with the fulfillment of connectedness goals for low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, people. In the remainder of this intro- duction, we detail the operation of this system and then describe our research strategy.</region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="74" page="1" column="2">The goal of the risk regulation system is to optimize the sense of safety or comfort that is possible given one’s relationship circumstances. This sense of assurance or safety is experienced as a feeling of relative invulnerability to hurt. To optimize this sense of <marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> assurance, this system functions dynamically and adjusts to relationship circumstance. In particular, it shifts the priority given to the goals of seeking closeness and protecting oneself against rejection so as to minimize the likelihood and pain of being hurt and vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="28" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2006</xref>). Such a system is needed to govern or arbitrate people’s behavior in risky situations—situations of dependence where one partner’s actions constrain the other’s capacity to satisfy important needs and goals. Couples are interdependent in multiple ways, ranging from deciding whose movie preference to favor on a given week- end to deciding what constitutes a fair allocation of household chores. Couples must also negotiate different personalities, such as merging one partner’s laissez-faire nature with the other’s more controlled style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48" id="29" class="deo:Reference">Kelley, 1979</xref>). Given multiple layers of interdependence, areas of incompatibility and conflict are inevitable— raising the possibility that one’s partner might not prove to be responsive to one’s needs. Once the specter of rejection is raised, people must choose how much dependence (and, thus, how much vulnerability) they safely can risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48" id="30" class="deo:Reference">Kelley, 1979</xref>). Throughout the course of the relationship, partners need to make iterative and often unconscious choices between seeking connection (increasing dependence) and self- protection (decreasing dependence). Consequently, to risk being in the relationship, people need a system in place that functions to keep them feeling reasonably safe in a context of continued vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="31" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="32" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref> illustrates how the risk regulation system operates to<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> govern people’s choices in dependent situations. Situations that involve interpersonal risk and vulnerability automatically activate two competing goals—the goal of seeking connection (Path A) and the goal of protecting against rejection (Paths B and C). The link between risk and the appetitive goal of connection reflects the functionalist argument that the best means of managing a capri- cious and dangerous world is to seek connection to others who will meet one’s needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="36" class="deo:Reference">Bowlby, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48" id="37" class="deo:Reference">Kelley, 1979</xref>; Leary &amp; Baumeister, 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60" id="38" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80" id="39" class="deo:Reference">Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1996</xref>). The link between risk and the aversive goal of self-protection (Path B) and between connectedness and self-protection goals (Path C) reflect the unfortunate reality that others will not always be motivated to do so. Certain situations, such as conflicts of interest, are also riskier than others. In such situations, even generally responsive others might not meet one’s needs. Certain people, such as those low in self-esteem (Murray, Rose, Bellavia, Holmes, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70" id="40" class="deo:Reference">Kusche, 2002</xref>), high in attachment anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60" id="41" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003</xref>), or high in rejection sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="42" class="deo:Reference">Downey &amp; Feldman, 1996</xref>), are more hurt by another’s inattentiveness. For these reasons, the combination of risk and the desire to seek connection activates the goal of self-protection. The model further stipulates that the intensity of the conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals depends on the immediacy of the provoking risk. The moderating path (Path D) linking risk immediacy to the strength of connectedness and self- protection goals captures this assumption. Imagine that Harry’s best friend broke a promise to him—a threat that is less immediate<marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> because it arises from the external relationship world. Such risks induce feelings of vulnerability and activate the goal of approaching his spouse Sally for comfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="46" class="deo:Reference">Bowlby, 1969</xref>). Needing her comfort then activates the goal of protecting against the possibility of Sally’s rejection or nonresponsiveness to his need for support (Path C). Now imagine that it is Sally who broke a promise—a threat that is more immediate because it arises internal to Harry’s relationship world. Such an experience with risk directly activates connectedness (Path A) and self-protection goals (Path B) and thereby intensifies the goal conflict (because risks internal to the relationship activate self-protection goals both directly [Path B] and indirectly [Path C]). Consequently, Harry’s desire to approach Sally is likely to be all the more ambivalent when the provoking risk is internal to his relationship because he needs the comfort of the very person who made him feel hurt and vulnerable. Once activated, whether directly (Path B) or indirectly (Path C), the goal of protecting the self against rejection then triggers an executive control system (Path E). This system functions as a stop– go routine— one that resolves the conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals by helping people identify which specific situations should be avoided and which situations are safe to approach. The dotted line spanning uncontrolled to controlled processes at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="47" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref> reflects the assumption that the operation of the control system (and its behavioral output) requires progressively greater cognitive resources than does initial goal activation. The paths internal to the control system (Paths F and G) illustrate the two interconnected “if . . . then” contingency rules that direct Sally toward the situations where it feels safe to increase dependence on Harry and away from situations where caution seems needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="48" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2006</xref>). The rules serving this directive function involve (a) an appraisal rule that assesses the likelihood of a partner’s acceptance or rejection in the situation (Path F) and (b) a signaling rule that links state perceptions of a partner’s acceptance or rejection to the experience of gratified or hurt feelings and coincident gains or losses in self-esteem (Path G). The assessed risk and pain of rejection then regulate people’s subsequent willingness to risk greater dependence with a specific partner (Path H). For people to pursue activated connectedness goals in response to risk, they should perceive reason to trust in their partner’s responsiveness to their needs in these situations (Reis, Clark, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74" id="49" class="deo:Reference">Holmes, 2004</xref>), and the prospect of approaching the partner should affirm rather than threaten the self (Murray, Griffin, Rose, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="50" class="deo:Reference">Bellavia, 2003</xref>). The existing literature provides good initial support for the basic assumptions underlying the risk regulation model. First, indirect evidence suggests that interpersonal risk activates connectedness goals. General concerns about interpersonal rejection (whether chronic or acute) sensitize people to social cues in their environ- ment. Rejection by strangers in a computerized chat room increases people’s memory for (positive and negative) social events in another’s purported diary (Gardner, Pickett, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35" id="51" class="deo:Reference">Brewer, 2000</xref>). Chronically desiring greater social connection also increases people’s accuracy in detecting social cues, such as vocal tone and facial expression, that reveal which specific others might be capable of meeting needs for social connection (Gardner, Pickett, Jefferis, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="52" class="deo:Reference">Knowles, 2005</xref>; Pickett, Gardner, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73" id="53" class="deo:Reference">Knowles, 2004</xref>). Rejection by strangers increases people’s tendency to behave in ways that might elicit positive social responses from novel others:<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> It increases willingness to solicit friendships (Maner, DeWall, Baumeister, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56" id="55" class="deo:Reference">Schaller, 2007</xref>), conform (Williams, Cheung, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83" id="56" class="deo:Reference">Choi, 2001</xref>), and work harder on a collective task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84" id="57" class="deo:Reference">Williams &amp; Sommer, 1997</xref>). Indirectly priming rejection by priming failure- related thoughts also activates thoughts of seeking proximity to others (Mikulincer, Birnbaum, Woddis, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58" id="58" class="deo:Reference">Nachmias, 2000</xref>) and increases the accessibility of a romantic partner’s name (Mikulincer, Gillath, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59" id="59" class="deo:Reference">Shaver, 2002</xref>). Second, considerable evidence suggests that people are motivated to avoid situations where they might be rejected or hurt. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50" id="60" class="deo:Reference">Leary and Baumeister (2000)</xref> argued that avoiding rejection is so important that the self-system evolved to gauge rejection threats. They argued that self-esteem is a sociometer that measures a person’s perceived likelihood of being accepted by others and regulates behavior. In this metric, painful drops in self-esteem signal rejection and motivate people to avoid hurtful situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53" id="61" class="deo:Reference">MacDonald &amp; Leary, 2005</xref>). Consistent with this logic, being ostracized by strangers or anticipating a future absence of social connection decreases people’s willingness to put themselves in situations where they might be vulnerable to others. Such experiences both decrease people’s willingness to sacrifice their own interests to benefit others (Twenge, Baumeister, DeWall, Ciarocco, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81" id="62" class="deo:Reference">Bartels, 2007</xref>) and increase their willingness to aggress against offending others (Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82" id="63" class="deo:Reference">Stucke, 2001</xref>). Third, models of attitudes, emotion, and personality assume that both approach–appetitive and avoidance–aversive goal systems regulate behavior (Cacioppo, Gardner, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="64" class="deo:Reference">Berntson, 1999</xref>; Carver, Sutton, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="65" class="deo:Reference">Scheier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32" id="66" class="deo:Reference">Gable, 2005</xref>; Gable, Reis, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33" id="67" class="deo:Reference">Elliot, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44" id="68" class="deo:Reference">Higgins, 1998</xref>). Our model converges with these traditions in assuming that ambivalence is a poor guide to behavior and that effective action requires the resolution of goal conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="69" class="deo:Reference">Cacioppo et al., 1999</xref>). This assumption also resonates with Lewin’s classic conceptions of the life space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="70" class="deo:Reference">Deutsch &amp; Krauss, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41" id="71" class="deo:Reference">Hall &amp; Lindzey, 1957</xref>) and depic- tions of approach–avoidance conflicts within learning theory traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="72" class="deo:Reference">Dollard &amp; Miller, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="73" class="deo:Reference">Epstein, 1982</xref>). In Lewinian terms, the need for assurance from threat activates a tension system. This tension system imbues situations likely to heighten vulnerability concerns with negative valence and situations likely to minimize such concerns with positive valence. The respective strength of these valences then orients behavior. If rejection is more hurtful than acceptance is gratifying, the push to self-protect (and avoid negative situations) will be stronger than the pull to connect (and approach positive situations). In fact, the closer Sally gets to Harry in such situations, the more motivating the goal of avoiding rejection becomes (because rejection becomes a greater concern the closer Sally gets to meeting her connectedness goals). However, the pull to connect will be stronger than the push to avoid if acceptance is more gratifying than rejection is hurtful.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="96" page="3" column="2">For the risk regulation system to be functional in regulating goal pursuit, it needs to adapt itself to suit specific relationship circumstances. If Sally generally perceives Harry to be responsive to her needs, becoming wary of Harry at the first sign of insensitivity is not the optimal means of sustaining the needed sense of assurance. However, if Sally generally perceives Harry to be unresponsive, <marker type="page" number="4"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> such a response might be Sally’s best available means of sustaining some minimal sense of safety from harm. To respond dynamically and efficiently in ongoing situations of dependence, the control system depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="80" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref> needs a heuristic means of estimating the level of risk inherent in newly encountered situations. The moderating path (Path I) linking perceptions of a partner’s acceptance to the operation of the control system illustrates how this calibration process occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="81" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2006</xref>). Perceptions of a partner’s acceptance and responsiveness— expectations that reflect properties of a person’s disposition and specific relationship experiences—interact with features of the event to control the sensitivity of the appraisal and signaling rules that guide subsequent behavior in risky situations (Murray, Bellavia, Rose, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64" id="82" class="deo:Reference">Griffin, 2003</xref>; Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003). How might this risk regulation system operate for low and high self-esteem people? General expectations of rejection, such as those embodied in low self-esteem, make specific rejection experiences all the more painful and motivating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50" id="83" class="deo:Reference">Leary &amp; Baumeister, 2000</xref>; Nezlek, Kowalski, Leary, Blevins, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72" id="84" class="deo:Reference">Holgate, 1997</xref>). People with low self- esteem also underestimate how much their dating or marital partner values and loves them (Murray, Holmes, Griffin, Bellavia, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68" id="85" class="deo:Reference">Rose, 2001</xref>). Consequently, situations of dependence are inher- ently riskier for low self-esteem people because feeling rejected poses a larger proportional loss to a precarious and easily threat- ened sense of their worthiness of interpersonal connection. A control system that prioritizes self-protection (prevention) goals in such situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43" id="86" class="deo:Reference">Higgins, 1996</xref>)— one that is calibrated to quickly detect rejection, strongly signal the possibility of further hurt, and then motivate interdependence-minimizing behaviors— best affords low self-esteem people (i.e., lows) some minimal continued sense of assurance or safety from harm. Consistent with these hypotheses, people with low self-esteem are quick to perceive rejection in events as innocuous as a partner being in a bad mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="87" class="deo:Reference">Bellavia &amp; Murray, 2003</xref>) or a partner identifying a negative quality in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70" id="88" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2002</xref>). Low self-esteem people then respond to induced anxieties about rejection by minimizing their partner’s value and, thus, blunting the anticipated pain of rejection in advance. They rely less on their partner as a source of self-esteem and comfort (Murray, Holmes, MacDonald, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69" id="89" class="deo:Reference">Ellsworth, 1998</xref>), and they also evaluate their partner’s qualities more negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69" id="90" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 1998</xref>, 2002). For people high in self-esteem (i.e., highs), there is little need for such a self-protectively calibrated executive control system. For highs, robust and optimistic expectations of a partner’s (and others’) acceptance render specific rejections less painful (Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003). Consequently, a control system that prioritizes connectedness (promotion) goals in such situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43" id="91" class="deo:Reference">Higgins, 1996</xref>)— one that is calibrated to readily perceive acceptance, weakly signal the potential for hurt, and then motivate connection or interdependence-increasing behaviors—should better afford highs a continued sense of safety or assurance in the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="92" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this logic, people with high self-esteem even appraise their own faults as evidence of their partner’s acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69" id="93" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 1998</xref>). They also respond to induced concerns about their dating partner’s likely annoyance with them by reporting greater feelings of closeness to their partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70" id="94" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2002</xref>, Experiment 2).<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> In sum, when the specter of interpersonal risk and vulnerability activates connectedness goals, people with high self-esteem should be more likely to actualize this goal than people with low self- esteem. This should occur precisely because the activation of connectedness goals also activates the signature style underlying the operation of that person’s risk regulation system.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="100" page="4" column="2">People with high self-esteem should report stronger chronic desires for connectedness and weaker chronic concerns with self- protection relative to people with low self-esteem. Their goal pursuits should also be differentially contingent on circumstance. Greater relationship stability and, thus, greater reason to trust in the partner’s availability should foster stronger desires to connect to the partner for both. However, such reason to trust in the relationship’s stability should temper self-protection concerns only for high self-esteem people. Accordingly, in an initial correlational study, we administered measures of global self-esteem, connectedness goals (i.e., focus on relationship positives), and self-protection goals (i.e., focus on relationship negatives) to people in dating relationships. We expected people with high self-esteem to report stronger connectedness goals and weaker self-protection goals. We also expected people in longer relationships to report greater focus on seeking connectedness regardless of self-esteem. However, we expected such evidence of a partner’s continued availability to temper self-protection concerns for high self-esteem, but not low self- esteem, people.</region>

The automatic activation of this goal should be evident in spontaneous, implicit associations to risk and in the desire to focus on positive aspects of the relationship rather than perseverate on the negative (Elliot, Gable, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="103" class="deo:Reference">Mapes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32" id="104" class="deo:Reference">Gable, 2005</xref>).

Accordingly, in Experiment 1, we primed the general salience of external interpersonal risk by asking participants to think of a time when a significant other disappointed them.

Consequently, for people high in self-esteem, activating connectedness goals should trigger their execution or application (because the risk regulation systems of highs place greater weight on connectedness). In contrast, for people low in self-esteem, activating connectedness goals should trigger their suppression (because the risk regulation systems of lows place greater weight on self- protection). Consistent with our distinction between goal activation and execution, current models of stereotyping assert that the respective strength of potentially competing goals, such as acquir- ing knowledge and enhancing the self, governs whether activated stereotypes are applied to specific group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49" id="112" class="deo:Reference">Kunda &amp; Spencer, 2003</xref>). In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55" id="113" class="deo:Reference">Macrae and Johnston (1998)</xref> argued that even goals activated without conscious awareness can be overridden by explicit situational cues that suggest goal pursuit might be hazardous or risky. For people high in self-esteem, activating connectedness goals should result in desires for connection that match behavioral intentions and implicit associations to risk that match more deliberative responses. First, when interpersonal risk is primed (and connectedness goals are thus activated indirectly), high self-esteem people should seek out risky situations of dependence within their relationship (e.g., self-disclosing, seeking support). Second, directly priming approach/connectedness goals should also result in positive implicit and explicit associations to the partner. This convergence in more and less deliberative responses should emerge precisely because the control system of highs typically prioritizes connectedness over self-protection. 1 For people low in self-esteem, the desire to connect should not translate into greater intention to seek connection by entering into risky situations of interdependence. Instead, they should suppress such goals when contemplating which actions to take in their relationships, much as people motivated to avoid prejudice resist applying stereotypes when they sense their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49" id="114" class="deo:Reference">Kunda &amp; Spencer, 2003</xref>). Accordingly, the simultaneous activation of connectedness and self-protection goals should result in implicit associations to the partner that reflect the desire to connect but, in stark contrast, avowed behavioral intentions that reflect the need to distance. In a sense, the heart might seek closeness, whereas the mind resists it. Signs of such an approach–avoidance conflict are evident among people most wary of interpersonal dependence. In a study of transference, young women with a history of parental abuse responded with positive facial affect to a novel other who resembled the abusive parent, yet they reported mistrusting and not caring about this novel other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="115" class="deo:Reference">Berenson &amp; Andersen, 2006</xref>). When primed to think about being disappointed by a significant other, people anxious–ambivalent in attachment style were quicker to identify “talk” in a lexical decision task, but they professed trusting their partner less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57" id="116" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer, 1998</xref>).<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> Accordingly, in Experiment 2, we included dependent measures tapping the willingness to risk interdependence. We expected high self-esteem, but not low self-esteem, people to respond to interpersonal risk (and, thus, the indirect activation of connectedness goals) by expressing stronger intentions to enter dependent situations within their relationships. In Experiments 3 and 4, we directly primed approach/connectedness goals and then measured explicit reports of relationship closeness (Experiments 3 and 4) and implicit associations to the partner (Experiment 4). Among high self-esteem people, we expected priming approach goals to produce greater feelings of connection to the partner on both implicit and explicit measures. Among low self-esteem people, we expected priming approach goals to activate positive implicit associations to the partner (reflecting the activation of connectedness goals) and diminished reports of closeness on the explicit measure (reflecting the operation of a self-protectively calibrated control system).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="127" page="5" column="2">If risk regulation involves a secondary corrective or executive control system, its operation should require greater cognitive resources than the activation of connectedness goals consumes. Consequently, experiences that impair executive control should not affect the activation of connectedness goals, but they should impair correction. This logic stems both from models of interpersonal perception and attribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37" id="120" class="deo:Reference">Gilbert, 1989</xref>; Macrae, Bodenhausen, Schloerscheidt, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54" id="121" class="deo:Reference">Milne, 1999</xref>) and from models of self- regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61" id="122" class="deo:Reference">Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37" id="123" class="deo:Reference">Gilbert (1989)</xref> argued that the attribution processes that correct unwar- ranted dispositional inferences occur only if a person has sufficient cognitive resources. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61" id="124" class="deo:Reference">Muraven and Baumeister (2000)</xref> argued that people are successful in overriding automatic impulses only if they have sufficient self-regulatory resources for self- control available. If the risk regulation system does require executive control, even low self-esteem people should react to risk salience by pursuing connectedness goals in situations where executive control is usurped (and the operation of their self-protectively calibrated risk regulation system is compromised). In Experiments 5 and 6, we manipulated general or external interpersonal risk and executive control. We manipulated executive control by depleting self- regulatory strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61" id="125" class="deo:Reference">Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000</xref>) and by increasing cognitive load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37" id="126" class="deo:Reference">Gilbert, 1989</xref>). We then measured people’s intention to enter risky relationship situations. When risk was primed and executive control was usurped, we expected low self- esteem (and high self-esteem) people to seek greater interdependence, reporting behavioral intentions likely to fulfill activated connectedness goals.</region>

Consequently, even people normally inclined to trust might reduce dependence in situations where rejection risks are more immediate. Moreover, acting on such self-protection goals might require little executive control. Imagine that Sally routinely criticizes Harry’s productivity and organizational skills. After a stressful day at work, even a high self-esteem Harry might fear approaching Sally for support. With repeated experience, keeping his distance in such situations could even become his automatic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="135" class="deo:Reference">Bargh &amp; Ferguson, 2000</xref>). We examined this possibility in Experiment 7 by manipulating the salience of the actual romantic partner’s past transgressions. We then measured the activation of connectedness and self- protection goals in a lexical decision task. We expected even high self-esteem people primed with their partner’s transgressions to show heightened activation of self-protection goals when circumstances warranted it—that is, when they had not already forgiven the transgression. Second, people normally prone to self-protect should become all the more cautious in situations where the pain of rejection is intensified. For instance, a low self-esteem Harry should be even more hesitant to increase interdependence in those situations where he really needs reassurance (i.e., stronger connection goal) and Sally seems disapproving. When needs to connect are heightened, the potential of rejection should be of even greater concern, polarizing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="136" class="deo:Reference">Epstein, 1982</xref>). We examined this possibility in Experiment 8 by manipulating the strength of approach/ connectedness goals and the severity of the actual dating partner’s criticism. We then measured people’s willingness to increase interdependence by seeking and providing support. When the desire to approach or seek connection is heightened, we expected a partner’s criticisms to sting all the more, motivating low self- esteem people to actively distance themselves from caregiving situations that highlight the need to be interdependent.<marker type="block"/> This article presents the first experimental test of a new theoretical perspective on risk regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="139" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2006</xref>). It departs from prior research in three major ways. First, it demonstrates that the general salience of interpersonal risk automatically activates the goal of seeking connection to one’s current romantic partner for both low and high self-esteem people. In contrast, prior research on dependence regulation processes assumed that rejection activated only the desire to self-protect among lows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69" id="140" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 1998</xref>, 2002). Second, it demonstrates that risk regulation involves a secondary, executive control system that routinely thwarts connectedness desires for low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, people. Third, it demonstrates how fluidly and flexi- bly the calibration of the risk regulation system shifts to accom- modate the immediacy of the threat and the strength of connectedness and self-protection goals. 2</region>

The measure of connectedness goals tapped people’s desire to nurture and focus on positive experiences in the relationship, such as thinking of fun things to do together—a motivational precondition for connectedness.

Greater objective evidence of a partner’s availability predicted heightened connectedness desires for low and high self- esteem people. However, only high self-esteem people were able to set aside self-protection concerns as their relationships endured and provided greater objective reason to trust their partner. These data suggest that the risk regulation system is differentially calibrated as a function of self-esteem: Experiences that foster connectedness goals are not sufficient to lessen self-protection concerns among low self-esteem people.</region>

Participants randomly assigned to the general interpersonal risk or experimental condition then provided a written description of a time when they felt intensely disappointed, hurt, or let down by someone close to them. Participants were instructed to describe both what happened and how they felt about the experience at the time in detail. Participants indicated these episodes involved good friends (14%), best friends (20%), family members (16%), past romantic partners (32%), or the current romantic partner (14%). 4 Participants in the control condition described their commute to campus. All participants then completed the lexical decision task. Participants were seated in front of a computer and were instructed to indicate whether each target stimulus that appeared was a word or a nonword (by pressing the appropriate key). Participants were encouraged to respond as quickly as they could without making errors. The task contained 250 trials (125 words and 125 nonwords). The target words fell into three categories: (a) 32 words tapping connectedness goals (e.g., vow, hug, kiss, join, want, grow, hope, rely, faith, trust), (b) 10 words tapping self-protection goals (e.g., retreat, protect, defense, caution, careful, prevent, watchful), and (c) 25 words tapping hostility (e.g., oppose, condemn, angry, blame, hate, annoy, accuse). (We included the hostility words to provide an implicit measure of threat severity.) To distinguish the activation of connectedness (or self-protection) goals from the activation of positive or negative affect, we also included 15 positive and 15 negative noninterpersonal words (i.e., examples of fruits and insects, respectively). The remaining words were fillers. We created the nonwords by changing the last letter of a word matched in length to each target word in a way that turned it into a nonword. The words and nonwords were presented randomly, and reaction times (in milliseconds) were recorded. Participants then completed some filler measures and a manipulation check assessing feelings of interpersonal vulnerability. All participants were then probed for suspicion, debriefed, and thanked for their participation. 5</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="192" page="8" column="2">Was thinking of a time when a significant other disappointed or hurt them threatening enough to elicit participants’ perceptions of risk? To examine this question, we conducted a regression analysis predicting interpersonal vulnerability from the centered main effects of self-esteem, experimental condition (i.e., 1 risk prime, 0 control), and the Self-Esteem Condition interaction. This analysis revealed significant main effects for global self-esteem, .26, sr 2 .07, t(85) 3.38, p .001, and experimental condition, .67, sr 2 .44, t(85) 8.60, p .001. The interaction was not significant, .07, sr 2 .00, t(84) 1. As expected, participants primed to think of an interpersonal disappointment reported feeling significantly more hurt, rejected, and disappointed about the incident (M 4.14) than did control participants (M 2.38). Did interpersonal risk make the construct of seeking connection more accessible, suggesting the activation of a goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="189" class="deo:Reference">Aarts et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79" id="190" class="deo:Reference">Shah et al., 2002</xref>)? We first subjected reaction times to both words and nonwords to a logarithmic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="191" class="deo:Reference">Fazio, 1990</xref>). Within each word category, we then averaged response times for correct responses made within 3,000 ms (i.e., “yes” for actual words, and “no” for nonwords). Next, we conducted a series of three-step hierarchical regression analyses predicting reaction times to connectedness, self-protection, and hostility-related words. In the first step, we entered centered responses to nonwords and similarly valenced noninterpersonal words (i.e., fruit words for connectedness, insect words for self-protection and hostility- related words) to control for individual differences in reaction time and responses to affectively similar words, respectively. Next, we entered the centered main effects of experimental condition and self-esteem. We entered the Condition Self-Esteem interaction</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="193" confidence="possible" page="8" column="2">4 In this experiment (and all subsequent experiments utilizing the interpersonal risk prime), we found parallel findings when we omitted those participants who described an incident involving their current romantic partner. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the observed effects do indeed reflect the effects of making risk in the more external interpersonal world salient. 5 We selected the connectedness and self-protection words on the basis of word ratings provided by undergraduate psychology students. The connectedness words received relatively high ratings on the dimensions of familiarity and “the extent to which the word captures the idea of increasing one’s sense of closeness or connection to another person” and relatively low ratings on the dimension of “being cautious or wanting to stop something bad from happening.” The opposite was the case for the self- protection words. Hostility words received relatively high ratings on the dimension “the extent to which the word captures the idea of maintaining some separation or distance between oneself and another person” and relatively low ratings on the other dimensions.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="204" page="9" column="1">Supporting the appetitive link in the risk regulation system, situations that highlight the risks of depending on another seem to activate the goal of seeking connection. People primed to think of a time when a significant other disappointed them were quicker to identify words associated with seeking connection in the lexical decision task (relative to control participants). Impressively, this effect is opposite to what one might expect on the basis of a semantic priming effect, and it emerged regardless of people’s chronic self-esteem level. However, people’s greater speed in recognizing connectedness words in response to risk might simply reflect the activation of a schema rather than a goal per se (Mikulincer &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60" id="203" class="deo:Reference">Shaver, 2003</xref>). Elliot and Freyer (in press) argued that behavioral intentions toward a goal object are elemental to goals and, thus, basic to demonstrating their existence. Accordingly, we obtained direct measures of behavioral intentions to approach or avoid situations of dependence in subsequent experiments.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="209" page="9" column="1">Experiment 1 suggested that making the general risks of interdependence salient automatically activates connectedness goals. Does this indirect activation of connectedness goals then trigger self-protection goals and the operation of the control system—a corrective system that intervenes between goal activation and execution? If it does, priming interpersonal risk should have different effects on the behavioral intentions of low and high self- esteem people. People with high self-esteem should intend to act on the basis of heightened desires for connection, risking greater interdependence within their current dating relationship. However, <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> people with low self-esteem should be more cautious, resisting interdependence despite the goal of connecting. We designed Experiment 2 to examine these hypotheses. We asked experimental participants to describe a time when a significant other hurt or disappointed them. We then measured people’s desire to connect to the partner and focus on the positive aspects of their relationship and their intention to behave in ways that might actually fulfill such goals. To do this, we developed two new measures of people’s intention to enter specific risky relationship situations— concrete situations that diagnose a partner’s motives by affording the partner the opportunity to behave selflessly or selfishly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48" id="208" class="deo:Reference">Kelley, 1979</xref>).</region>

Participants in the control condition described their commute to campus. All participants then proceeded to the purported second study and answered a series of computer-administered questions about their current romantic relationships. The dependent measures were mixed among filler items. Specifically, participants completed the measures of connectedness ( .83) and self-protection goals ( .86) utilized in the correlational study. They then completed a measure of their willingness to enter interdependent situations, a measure of the priority they put on interdependent activities, and measures of general life promotion and prevention goals. The final measure indexed mood. Participants were then probed for suspicion and debriefed.</region>

The regression analysis predicting this composite revealed a significant main effect of interpersonal risk and a significant Self-Esteem Interpersonal Risk interaction. As expected, participants high in self-esteem responded to interpersonal risk (and the indirect activation of connectedness goals) by reporting greater willingness to seek out risky interdependent situations within their relationship, .48, sr 2 .10, t(75) 2.89, p .01.

However, only high self-esteem people acted on the basis of stronger connectedness desires, actually becoming more willing to put themselves in risky but connectedness-increasing situations. Importantly, this latter effect was specific to the interpersonal risk prime. We believe that the comparative caution of low self-esteem people reflected the operation of a self-protectively calibrated risk regulation system. However, the null effects of condition for low self-esteem people limited our ability to draw the conclusion that low self-esteem people were actually executing self-protection goals in this situation. We designed Experiments 3 and 4 to provide stronger evidence that the desire to approach triggers a self-protectively calibrated risk regulation system for low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, people.</region>

How-</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="251" confidence="possible" page="11" column="2">8 The fact that low-esteem people reported stronger desires to focus on the positive within their relationships when they were reminded of a time when they disappointed another points to one possible way in which they might stabilize their relationships against their more destructive behaviors. Specifically, knowledge of their failures in other relationships may motivate lows to try to do better in the current one. Consistent with this logic, low self-esteem people engage in reparative relationship behaviors provided those behaviors do not put them at any real risk of rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63" id="249" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2007</xref>). 9 Low self-esteem participants reported greater willingness to risk interdependence than high self-esteem participants in the control condition. Although this might seem counter to our theoretical model, this is not surprising from our vantage point. Given heightened desires for social connection (Leary, Tambor, Terdal, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51" id="250" class="deo:Reference">Downs, 1995</xref>), low self-esteem people likely want greater levels of interdependence in their relationships. However, when the prospect of being hurt and vulnerable is salient, such hopes seem to be quickly set aside (as our model would anticipate).</region>

Participants then completed an adaptation of Lockwood et al.’s (2002, Experiment 2) implicit goal priming task, which we described as a pilot measure for a word-association test. Across conditions, this task involved sorting 48 words into three categories of related words (which participants had to discern). Participants in the generic approach goal condition sorted words that fell into the categories of approaching a desired state (e.g., strive, win, strengthen, accomplish, thrive, achieve, pursue, pledge), cooking (e.g., roast, aromatic, saut  ́), and child care (e.g. baby, bottle, infant, cradle). Participants in the relationship approach goal condition sorted generic and interpersonally oriented words into the categories of approaching a desired state (e.g., encourage, hope, want, faith, devote, forgive, promise), cooking, and child care. 10 Control participants sorted words into the categories of music (e.g., guitar, opera), cooking, and child care.

This five-item scale ( .95) tapped feelings of connection to the partner (e.g., “I am closer to my partner than any other person in my life,” “I feel extremely attached to my partner,” “I would choose to spend time with my partner over anyone else in my life”). Participants responded to these items on 9-point scales (1 not at all true, 9 completely true). State self-esteem. This three-item scale ( .89) indexed participants’ current feelings about themselves on 7-point bipolar scales (i.e., bad about myself . . . good about myself, unhappy with myself . . . happy with myself, rejected by others . . . accepted by others).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="285" page="13" column="1">Experiment 3 suggested that implicitly priming the goal of approaching a desired relationship state activates self-protective corrective processes for low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, people. When primed with relationship approach goals, but not generic ones, low self-esteem people actually reported feeling significantly less close to their dating partner (relative to control participants). This effect is directly opposite to what one might expect on the basis of a semantic priming effect (and opposite to the positive effect that the prime had on state self-esteem). However, we did not measure the activation of connectedness goals, limiting our ability to argue that the prospect of approaching a desired state in the relationship creates the experience of goal conflict for low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, people.</region>

Specifically, we expected lows to react more positively to the partner on the implicit task while still disavowing feelings of closeness to the partner on the explicit <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> measure.

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="311" page="13" column="2">The experimenter told participants they would be participating in a study on people’s thoughts and feelings about their relationships. Participants first completed a questionnaire that included demographic questions (e.g., gender, age) and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75" id="302" class="deo:Reference">Rosenberg (1965)</xref> self-esteem scale. Participants then completed practice trials for the implicit partner evaluation task. This measure (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="303" class="deo:Reference">Dodgson &amp; Wood, 1998</xref>) tapped how quickly participants identified positive and negative traits as characteristic of the partner (thus, faster reaction times to positive traits and slower reaction times to negative traits reflected more positive implicit evaluations). The experimenter introduced this task as a categorization task. Participants were told that words would appear on the screen (one at a time) and that they had to indicate whether each word, a person descriptor such as warm or an object descriptor such as car, could ever possibly be used to describe their partner (by pressing yes or no keys). For the practice trials, they responded to 15 person descriptors and 15 object descriptors. If participants responded incorrectly on the practice trials, they received an error message (e.g., responding “no” to warm or “yes” to car). Participants then completed the implicit goal priming categorization task adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52" id="304" class="deo:Reference">Lockwood et al. (2002)</xref>. As in Experiment 3, participants in the generic approach goals condition sorted words that fell into the categories of approaching a desired state, cooking, and child care. (We utilized the generic prime to provide a convergent replication of the effects we observed with the relationship approach goals prime in Experiment 3.) Participants in<marker type="page" number="14"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> the generic avoidance goals condition sorted words that fell into the categories of avoiding a feared state (e.g., fail, pain, avert, avoid, hesitate), cooking, and child care. (We included an avoidance goals prime to determine whether avoidance goals also activated the control system.) Participants in the control condition sorted words that fell into the categories of music, cooking, and child care. All participants then completed the target trials for the implicit partner evaluation measure. This measure was composed of 240 target trials (120 person-descriptor words and 120 object- descriptor words). The target words of conceptual interest were 11 connectedness words (e.g., accepted, loved, respected, appreci- ated, wanted, connected, needed) and 38 positive interpersonal trait words (e.g., competent, smart, creative, funny, attractive, passionate, warm, forgiving, compassionate). We also included 7 positive mood words for control purposes (e.g., content, happy, joyful). Although we assumed that the desire to connect to the partner would be more likely to surface on quicker positive associations to the partner than on slower negative associations, we also included 15 distance words (e.g., blamed, unloved, hostile, distrusted), 38 negative traits words (e.g., thoughtless, selfish, stubborn, dumb), and 7 negative mood words (e.g., angry, sad, guilty). The remaining words were fillers. The words were presented in a random order for each participant, and reaction times (in milliseconds) were recorded. 11 All participants then completed the inclusion of other in the self scale, the five-item closeness measure ( .91) from Experiment 3, the nine-item mood measure from Experiment 2 ( .86), and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52" id="310" class="deo:Reference">Lockwood et al.

Did low self-esteem people react to heightened desires to connect by self-protectively disavowing feelings of closeness? To examine the first hypothesis, we first subjected reaction times to each person and object word to a logarithmic transformation ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="313" class="deo:Reference">Fazio, 1990</xref>). Within each word category, we then averaged response times for correct responses made within 3,000 ms. Next, we created composite measures of positive and negative implicit evaluations by averaging response times to<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> the connectedness and positive trait words and to the distance and negative trait words, respectively. On the first step of the hierarchical regressions predicting these composites, we entered reaction times to object words (to control for individual differences in response times) and to same-valence mood words (to control for reaction times to affectively similar words). On the second step, we entered the centered main effects of self-esteem and two dummy-coded contrasts representing the effects of condition (each contrast compared one of the experimental conditions against the control). We entered the Self- Esteem Condition contrast interaction terms in the final step. The regressions predicting the composite measure of closeness (inclusion of other in self and closeness, each transformed to a z score and averaged; .85), promotion goals, prevention goals, and mood were parallel, except they omitted the covariates. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6" id="315" class="deo:Reference">Table 6</xref> contains the predicted scores for participants relatively low and high in self-esteem. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7" id="316" class="deo:Reference">Table 7</xref> contains the results of the analyses.

They again disavowed feelings of connection to the partner on the explicit measure of closeness when the prospect of getting closer to the partner was primed.

If correction requires executive strength, diminishing this resource should result in low and high self-esteem people reacting similarly to risk. For both, a prior act of self-control should preempt the activation of the control system. Consequently, they should both react to interpersonal risk<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> salience by seeking greater connection to their partner. In Experiment 5, we manipulated both self-regulatory strength and general interpersonal risk. We then measured connectedness and self- protection goals, the willingness to risk interdependence, and feelings of dependence on the partner. We expected that when the risks of depending on others were salient and the capacity to regulate risk was usurped, lows would behave like highs—striving to fulfill needs for connection by seeking out risky, interdependent situations within their relationships.</region>

All participants watched a video of a woman being interviewed by an off-camera interviewer. Throughout the course of the video, one-syllable words appeared at the bottom of the screen for 10 s each. In the self-regulation depletion condition, participants were warned about the words, and they were instructed not to read or look at any of the words. Participants in the not-depleted control condition received no warning and no instructions regarding the words. All participants then completed the dependent measures, including the measures of connectedness goals ( .86), self-protection goals ( .84), entering interdependent situations ( .84), prioritizing interdependent activities ( .61), and dependence on the partner.</region>

De- pleted lows also reported less concern with self-protection and greater dependence on their partner when interpersonal risk was salient—the type of situation that typically triggers self-protective attempts to distance from the partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70" id="398" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2002</xref>). Experiment 5 thus provided good initial evidence that risk regulation does indeed involve an executive control system. However, our capacity to draw the conclusion that risk regulation generally consumes executive strength was limited by the fact that the effects were not as robust for high self-esteem people. We utilized a different manipulation of executive strength in Experiment 6 in an effort to redress this limitation.</region>

Participants randomly assigned to the general interpersonal risk condition then described a time when a significant other hurt or disappointed them. Participants in the control condition described their commute to school. The experimenter then introduced the cognitive busyness manipulation to participants in the busy condition. The experimenter asked these participants to learn and then continue to rehearse a nine-digit alphanumeric string as they completed a questionnaire about their relationships on computer. The computer prompted participants in the busy condition to report the string four times throughout the administration of the dependent measures. Participants in the not-busy condition did not learn or rehearse the string. All participants then completed the dependent measures, including the measures of connectedness goals ( .88), self-protection goals ( .86), entering interdependent situations ( .91), prioritizing interdependent activities ( .63), dependence on the partner, and mood ( .88).</region>

When risk regulation processes were preempted, low self-esteem people behaved like highs—seeking out those relationship situations that had the potential to fulfill heightened needs for connectedness. Low self- <marker type="page" number="20"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> esteem participants also reported stronger connectedness goals and greater dependence on their partner when they were cognitively busy than when they were not. Though unexpected, these effects also suggest that self-protective efforts to minimize dependence generally require executive control.

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="444" page="20" column="1">Experiments 1 and 2 suggested that interpersonal risk automatically activates connectedness goals. The activation of such approach goals then triggers the operation of the control system and its signature tendency to prioritize connectedness or self-protection concerns (Experiments 3 and 4). Consequently, low self-esteem people defend against heightened needs for connectedness by resisting dependence. In contrast, high self-esteem people react to increased desires for connection by seeking out situations in their relationships likely to fulfill this goal. However, when the operation of this corrective system is compromised, even low self- esteem people act on heightened needs for connectedness and seek out interdependent situations in the face of risk (Experiments 5 and 6). If the risk regulation system is functional, its operation should also be sensitive to variations in the strength of connectedness and self-protection goals. Specifically, feelings of vulnerability that arise directly from the partner’s actions should heighten self- protection concerns (Paths B and D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="442" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref>). As a result, even high self-esteem people might prioritize self-protection goals in situations where the need for caution is likely to be more pressing than usual. Imagine that experience has taught a high self-esteem Harry that Sally can’t be relied upon to respond sympathetically to his work woes. In this limited domain, he might self-protect and avoid closeness. In fact, with repeated experience, such pocketed avoidance might become habitual and activated automatically when the pressure to disclose in this domain arises (e.g., Neal, Wood, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71" id="443" class="deo:Reference">Quinn, 2006</xref>). In Experiment 7, we increased risk immediacy by having participants vividly describe a time when their current partner hurt or disappointed them. We then measured the implicit activation of connectedness and self-protection goals using the lexical decision task from Experiment 1. When risk was immediate, we expected even high self-esteem people to show heightened activation of self-protection goals when they had not forgiven their partner’s transgression (and, thus, these limited circumstances warranted caution).</region>

Participants randomly assigned to the partner risk prime condition then provided a written description of a time when they felt intensely disappointed, hurt, or let down by their current partner. Participants were instructed to describe both what happened and how they felt about the experience at the time in detail. Experimental participants then completed the lexical decision task from Experiment 1. They then completed a final questionnaire that contained the measure of mood ( .89) and questions about their appraisal of the transgression among fillers. Participants in the control condition completed the lexical decision task and questionnaire before they provided a brief description of a time when their partner hurt or disappointed them. (This allowed us to eliminate participants who could not think of an incident from both conditions.)</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="457" page="20" column="2">Did thinking of a hurtful transgression activate self-protection goals for even high self-esteem people? We first created a measure that indexed people’s tendency to put a positive, forgiving spin on the transgression by averaging responses to the two appraisal items and the coder’s happy-ending rating (each score was first transformed to a z score; .55). We then conducted a series of three-step hierarchical regressions predicting reaction times to connectedness, self-protection, and hostility-related words. In the first step, we entered centered responses to nonwords and same- valence noninterpersonal words (i.e., fruit words for connectedness, insect words for self-protection and hostility-related words) to control for individual differences in reaction time and responses to affectively similar words, respectively. Next, we entered a dummy-coded contrast for experiment condition (1 partner risk, 0 control) and the centered main effects of self-esteem and transgression appraisal. We entered all possible two-way interactions on the third step and the three-way interaction on the final step. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T13" id="456" class="deo:Reference">Table 13</xref> contains the predicted scores for participants relatively low and high in self-esteem in each condition.

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="477" page="22" column="1">When circumstance warrants, even people with high self-esteem evidence self-protectively calibrated risk regulation processes. When high self-esteem people had not forgiven their partner’s transgression, reminders of this hurt increased the cognitive accessibility of self-protection words and decreased the accessibility of connectedness words. They were both quicker to identify self- protection words and slower to identify connectedness words in the partner risk than in the control condition, suggesting differential goal activation. However, being reminded of this hurt actually seemed to suppress self-protection goals when high self-esteem people had forgiven the transgression. They were slower to identify self-protection words in the partner risk than in the control condition. The responses of high self-esteem people thus reveal implicit associations to risk that mirror more deliberative considerations. Unforgiven transgressions compelled more caution and less connectedness seeking. In contrast, it was forgiving the transgression (and the specter of being closer to the partner) that heightened self-protection for low self-esteem people. When lows had forgiven the transgression, they were actually quicker to identify self-protection words in the partner risk than in the control condition. The responses of low self-esteem people thus reveal implicit associations to risk that belie their more deliberative judgments. For lows, forgiving the transgression seemed to make the prospect of rejection of greater concern, prompting greater defensiveness even in goals that were activated automatically.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="482" page="22" column="1">If the risk regulation system is functional, its operation should also be sensitive to the magnitude of the conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals. Stronger desires to approach the partner should increase concerns about rejection (because rejection hurts more in the context of greater need). Activating approach goals should intensify the pressure to self-protect and reduce risk ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="479" class="deo:Reference">Epstein, 1982</xref>). This should be especially true for people prone to self-protect, such as those low in self-esteem. They should become all the more resistant to dependence in situations where the desire to approach makes a partner’s rejection of greater concern. In Experiment 8, we manipulated both the strength of approach goals and the severity of the dating partner’s criticism. We then measured the willingness to increase interdependence by seeking and<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> providing support within the relationship. We hoped to further replicate the opposite and ironic effect that approach goals have on the behavior of lows. That is, we expected a partner’s criticisms to sting all the more when approach goals were activated, motivating low self-esteem people to distance themselves from support situations.</region>

Each member of the couple was then seated individ- ually at one of two laboratory tables, arranged so that participants had their backs to their partners. The experimenter then told participants that both members of the couple would be completing identical sets of questionnaires and that they would proceed from one questionnaire to the next when both members of the couple had finished. The experimenter also reminded participants not to speak to one another as the study progressed. Participants then completed a questionnaire that contained demographic questions and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75" id="486" class="deo:Reference">Rosenberg (1965)</xref> self-esteem scale. Next, target participants in the partner criticism experimental condition were led to believe that their partner was spending an excessive amount of time listing qualities in the target that their partner disliked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70" id="487" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2002</xref>, Experiment 3). To achieve this end, the target participants received a one-page questionnaire that asked them to list important aspects of their partner’s character that they disliked. The instructions also stated that participants should not list any more than one such quality if that was all that easily came to mind. Target participants were led to believe that their partners received the identical questionnaire. However, the partners actually received a one-page questionnaire asking them to list as many of the items in their residence as they could. Through this subterfuge, target participants spent a few (anxious) minutes waiting for their partners to finish this task. (The experimenter stopped the partner 5 min after the target participant finished if the partner had not yet finished). In the control condition, targets and partner participants both received the one-page questionnaire that<marker type="page" number="23"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> asked them to list important aspects of their partner’s character that they disliked. As a result, control target participants finished the task at the same time as their partners (and had no reason to believe their partners perceived an inordinate number of faults). The experimenter then introduced the implicit approach– avoidance prime utilized in Experiment 4 under the guise of needing pilot data for a cognitive psychology study. Participants in the approach goals condition sorted words that fell into the categories of approaching a desired state, cooking, and child care. Participants in the avoidance goals condition sorted words that fell into the categories of avoiding a feared state, cooking, and child care. All participants then completed a questionnaire that contained the dependent measures among filler items. Participants completed measures tapping connectedness goals ( .88), self-protection goals ( .86), perceptions of the partner’s disregard, willingness to provide support to the partner, willingness to seek support from the partner, and state self-esteem. At this point in the experiment, the experimenter then asked participants to help with a further study. Under this subterfuge, we obtained an objective measure of people’s willingness to provide support to the partner. The experimenter explained that one member of the couple would be asked to give a speech about the challenges facing undergraduates that would be vid- eotaped for the office of the dean. The experimenter then asked the partner to pick a slip of paper from a cup to see who would give the speech. This slip always identified the partner. The experimenter then took the partner to another room, informed him or her that he or she would not be giving a speech, and asked the partner to write a note to the participant stating, “I’m really nervous. Do you think I can do this?” The experimenter then took the note back to the target participant and asked the target if he or she wanted to write a note in response (87.9% of participants wrote a return note). Participants then completed the manipulation check. The experimenter then probed for suspicion and conducted a process debriefing.</region>

When primed with the goal of approaching a desired state, people who had recently been hurt by their partner actually reported less desire to nurture their relationship on the measure of connectedness goals. Such paradoxical effects of approach goals were particularly evident among low self-esteem people. For lows, the stronger the goal to approach the partner, the more motivating the goal of avoiding rejection seemed to become. In particular, getting closer seemed to make<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> the prospect of rejection more aversive for lows, prompting greater defensiveness on the measures of behavioral intention. Specifically, when primed with approach, low self-esteem people internalized their partner’s criticism, worrying that their partner saw them as generally undesirable. They protected against such feelings of vulnerability by reducing their future willingness to seek and provide support, a component of interdependence critical for maintaining satisfying relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="534" class="deo:Reference">Collins &amp; Feeney, 2000</xref>). However, the behavior of these low self-esteem people shifted once the partner sought support and, thus, the prospect of connection guaranteed no risk of rejection (as our model would predict). Specifically, when approach goals were activated, low self-esteem people in the partner criticism condition actually provided objectively more supportive notes than did control participants. Thus, the partner’s expression of vulnerability in soliciting support seemed to obviate concerns about rejection, allowing low self-esteem people to act on the basis of heightened needs for connection.</region>

Given the vulnerability inherent in narrowing one’s social connections to focus on one partner, some level of circumspection is required and appropriate. However, to be happy over the longer term, people need to set rejection concerns aside and risk substantial dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="538" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, people low in self-<marker type="page" number="26"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> esteem—the very people most in need of social connection—are the least likely to take the kinds of interdependence risks that forge satisfying relationships.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="564" page="26" column="1">The correlational study captured the conflicted motivations of people low in self-esteem. For lows, greater relationship longevity predicted heightened desires to focus on the positive, connectedness-promoting aspects of the relationship. However, this greater objective reason to trust in the partner did not abate their concerns about vulnerability and loss. Instead, they tended to express stronger self-protection concerns in longer relationships. In contrast, high self-esteem people were appropriately judicious, more desirous of connection and less concerned about self- protection when they had greater reason to trust in the relationship’s stability. The risk regulation system depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="544" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref> sheds light on exactly how and why such differential dynamics emerge. This model assumes that the strongest, initial, and automatic response to the salience of external interpersonal risk is to seek connection to the partner (Path A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="545" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref>). This reflects the functionalist argument that the most effective means of dealing with an unpre- dictable world is to forge the types of interpersonal connections that will ensure one’s needs are met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48" id="546" class="deo:Reference">Kelley, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50" id="547" class="deo:Reference">Leary &amp; Baumeister, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60" id="548" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003</xref>; Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1996). Consistent with this logic, participants reminded of the risks of depending on significant others were quicker to identify connectedness words in a lexical decision task (Experiment 1), suggesting that risk automatically activates the goal of seeking connection. Such heightened needs for connection also surfaced in people’s self-reported goals. Participants primed with the risks of depending on others reported stronger desires to nurture the positive aspects of their relationships (Experiments 2 and 5). They also tended to report stronger desires to pursue positive life outcomes (Experiment 2). However, when an event internal to the relationship made rejection salient, self-protection goals evidenced readier activation (Paths B and D). The partner’s criticism suppressed connectedness goals for both low and high self-esteem people when they were primed with the general goal of approaching a desired state (Experiment 8). For people high in self-esteem, thinking of a partner transgression they had not forgiven also suppressed the activation of connectedness goals and heightened the activation of self-protection goals on the lexical decision task (Experiment 7). Once activated, self-protection goals then trigger an executive control system. This system optimizes assurance by directing people toward situations that offer a safe level of dependence. This intervening step between goal activation and execution reflects the reality that needs for connection are not likely to be met in all situations (Paths C and E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="549" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref>). The control system exists to resolve any conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals and to provide a clear direction for behavior (Cacioppo et al., 1999)—a directive that prioritizes self-protection for people low in self-esteem and connectedness for people high in self-esteem. The conflict low self-esteem people experience between connectedness and self-protection goals evidenced itself in ambivalent associations to risk. Although low self-esteem people reacted to risk by aspiring to focus on the positive, connectedness-promoting<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> aspects of their relationships, they did not take the actual steps necessary to increase interdependence (Experiment 2). Instead, directly priming the general goal of approaching a desired state triggered risk regulation processes that served self-protection goals. When primed with approach goals, low self-esteem people reported feeling less close to their dating partner (Experiments 3 and 4)—suggesting that the mere prospect of getting closer (evidenced in more positive implicit associations to the partner) activated the goal of keeping a safer distance (Experiment 4). They were also quicker to identify self-protection words in a lexical decision task when reminded of a partner transgression they had already forgiven (Experiment 7). Such data further suggest that the goal of getting closer (captured by the inclination to forgive) makes the goal of avoiding rejection all the more motivating. In fact, a partner’s criticism actually hurt low self-esteem people more when they were primed with approach than with avoidance goals. They then seemed to defend against this hurt by reporting less willingness to seek and provide support in their relationships (Experiment 8). However, a slight shift in circumstance prompted the expression of connectedness goals. When hurt but motivated to approach, lows wrote objectively more supportive notes in response to their partner’s clear and direct expression of need and receptiveness to connection. Thus, low self-esteem people seem perfectly willing to seek connection in situations that guarantee no risk of rejection (as our model would predict). In fact, low self- esteem people effectively minimize the chance of rejection by engaging in safe instrumental behaviors, such as finding a partner’s lost keys, that increase a partner’s dependence on them without increasing the risk of rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63" id="551" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2007</xref>). Rather than experiencing an acute conflict between connectedness and self-protection goals, high self-esteem people acted on the basis of heightened needs for connection in most circum- stances—seeking out the interdependent situations capable of fulfilling these goals. They responded to the general salience of interpersonal risk by reporting greater willingness to enter interdependent situations within their relationships (Experiment 2). When we directly primed the general goal of approaching a desired state, high self-esteem people reported feeling closer to their partners on both implicit and explicit measures (Experiment 4). When reminded of a partner transgression they had forgiven, they were also slower to respond to self-protection words in a lexical decision task (Experiment 7), suggesting that overriding self- protection goals can become an automatic aspect of risk regulation for people high in self-esteem. Do the divergent responses of low and high self-esteem people indicate the operation of a secondary, corrective control system? If risk regulation requires executive control, taxing executive strength should usurp correction, but it should not affect the activation of connectedness goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37" id="552" class="deo:Reference">Gilbert, 1989</xref>). Therefore, taxing executive strength should increase the likelihood that both low self-esteem (and high self-esteem) people will seek to fulfill connectedness goals. Consistent with this logic, merely making low self-esteem people cognitively busy increased the strength of connectedness goals (Experiment 6). When self-regulatory capacities were depleted, low self-esteem participants also responded to the general salience of risk by reporting diminished self-protection concerns and heightened dependence on their current dating partner (Experiment 5). Most critical, when executive strength was taxed, low and high self-esteem people both responded to the<marker type="page" number="27"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> reminder of the risks of depending on others by seeking out risky but connectedness-promoting situations of interdependence within their dating relationships. Limitations of the current data deserve mention. First, risk had a statistically significant main effect on the measure of connectedness goals only in Experiment 2. To examine the strength of the risk-connectedness main effect on this measure, we meta-analyzed the main effects of risk condition on connectedness goals across Experiments 2, 5, 6, and 8. Winer’s (1971) combined test revealed that the meta-analytic effect of risk was strong and significant (d .30, z 2.75, p .01). Second, the predicted Risk Executive Strength interaction predicting the willingness to risk interdependence composite was significant in Experiment 6 but only marginally significant in Experiment 5. A meta-analysis of this effect across Experiments 5 and 6 revealed a significant Executive Strength Risk interaction (d .35, z 2.58, p .05). This further suggests that risk automatically activates connectedness goals (because people seek greater interdependence in response to risk when executive strength is impaired). Third, the measure of self-protection goals revealed significant interactive effects involving condition only in Experiment 5. Low self-esteem people primed with risk actually reported less concern about rejection when self-regulatory strength was depleted. Such insight was not apparent in the other experiments—something that is perhaps unsurprising given people’s limited access to the contents of their consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85" id="556" class="deo:Reference">Wilson, 2002</xref>). In the experiments involving general (i.e., external) manipulations of risk, the evidence for the activation of self-protection goals remained largely indirect. We inferred the operation of these goals from the absence of behavioral intentions to risk interdependence in Experiment 2 and the effects of depleting executive strength on the intention to risk interdependence in Experiments 5 and 6. However, when the romantic partner’s actions made risk salient, we found stronger direct evidence of the activation of self-protection goals: Unfor- giving highs and forgiving lows were quicker to identify self- protection words when reminded of their partner’s transgression in Experiment 7. Low self-esteem people primed with approach goals also reported markedly decreased intentions to provide unsolicited support to a rejecting partner in Experiment 8. Of course, we cannot argue that self-esteem actually caused any of the effects we attribute to it. Fortunately, we do not wish to make this argument. Rather, we assume that self-esteem has its moderating effects because it functions as a powerful dispositional proxy for expectations of the partner’s acceptance and responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="557" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2006</xref>). If that is the case, other dispositions that capture general expectations of partner responsiveness, such as attachment anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60" id="558" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003</xref>), rejection sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="559" class="deo:Reference">Downey &amp; Feldman, 1996</xref>), or self-esteem that is contingent on interpersonal acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="560" class="deo:Reference">Crocker &amp; Wolfe, 2001</xref>), should have comparable effects on risk regulation. Direct measures of felt acceptance, such as trust in a partner’s responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46" id="561" class="deo:Reference">Holmes &amp; Rempel, 1989</xref>) or perceptions of the partner’s regard for the self (Murray, Bellavia, et al., 2003), should have parallel, and even stronger, effects. We included Bartholomew and Horowitz’s (1991) four-category attachment measure in the background measures in Experiments 1, 2, and 4 – 8 to examine the former possibility. We then reconducted the analyses in each experiment, using rejection anxiety as a moderator in place of self-esteem. Although this measure does not<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> provide as sensitive a barometer as current ones (e.g., Fraley, Waller, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="563" class="deo:Reference">Brennan, 2000</xref>), anxiety about rejection did reveal effects that paralleled the moderating effects of self-esteem we observed in Experiments 2, 4, and 7. 16,17</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="566" page="27" column="2">The risk regulation model contends that self-esteem moderates people’s responses to risk because chronic expectations of a specific partner’s acceptance determine the calibration of the risk regulation system. Alternate explanations are possible, however. Perhaps low self-esteem people generally responded more self- protectively to risk because the disappointment episodes they generated disproportionately sampled experiences within romantic relationships. To examine this possibility, we computed the cor- relation between self-esteem and the type of disappointment (romantic vs. not) in Experiments 1, 2, 5, and 6. The average corre- lation was near zero and nonsignificant in each experiment. Maybe, though, high self-esteem, but not low self-esteem, people sought greater interdependence in the face of risk because they recalled less serious interpersonal disappointments in the first place. If that were the case, the comparative caution of lows might be an appropriate response to the contingencies they faced. To examine this possibility, we coded the narratives in Experiments 2, 5, 6, and 7 for event severity (e.g., “Given the scope of things that can happen in life, how serious is the event described?”). We then reconducted our analyses including severity as a control variable. 18 All of the main effects of condition and the moderating effects of self-esteem remained significant.</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="571" confidence="possible" page="27" column="2">16 Given the multiple ways one might tap expectations of a specific partner’s acceptance and responsiveness— our hypothesized moderator— readers might wonder why we focused on global self-esteem. We utilized the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75" id="567" class="deo:Reference">Rosenberg (1965)</xref> measure because it captures stable, cross-situational expectations of acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50" id="568" class="deo:Reference">Leary &amp; Baumeister, 2000</xref>). Such expectations should be more sensitive to the cross-situational manipulations of risk we used in Experiments 1, 2, 5, and 6 than expectations that are specific to the relationship. We also favored this measure for testing risk regulation dynamics because it can tap negative evaluative associations to the self without requiring people to articulate fears about rejection in relationships. Consequently, it acts as a kind of projective test for capturing the kinds of doubts about one’s worthiness that should create interpersonal problems even for people who do not or cannot articulate these problems. Given that our data suggest that much of low self-esteem people’s motivational conflict may occur outside their awareness, such sensitivity is critical from our perspective. 17 Some readers might wonder whether satisfaction moderates risk regulation dynamics. We do not believe that satisfaction is likely to be a strong moderator because it represents an evaluative statement about the relationship that captures the outcome of such risk regulation dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="569" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2006</xref>). For instance, self-esteem and perceptions of a partner’s regard for the self predict changes in relationship satisfaction over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67" id="570" class="deo:Reference">Murray et al., 2000</xref>). As an outcome variable, satisfaction should function as only a poor proxy for the true moderating influences (i.e., self-esteem, perceived regard). We included a one-item measure of relationship satisfaction as a premeasure in each of the experiments to examine this logic. As we expected, further analyses did not reveal any systematic and significant moderating effects of satisfaction. 18 Participants in the experimental conditions consistently described more serious and upsetting events than did control participants.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="576" page="28" column="1">Alternately, low self-esteem people might have reacted to heightened motivations to connect by distancing because priming approach goals reduced regulatory fit and increased negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45" id="574" class="deo:Reference">Higgins, 2000</xref>). If that were the case, the distancing effects observed in Experiments 3, 4, and 8 might reflect the contaminat- ing effect of negative mood or diminished state self-esteem on relationship judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77" id="575" class="deo:Reference">Schwarz, 1990</xref>). To examine this possibility, we reconducted our analyses, including the dependent measures of mood (Experiment 4) and state self-esteem (Experiments 3 and 8) as control variables. All of the main effects of condition and the moderating effects of self-esteem remained significant. On a related note, risk might have activated stronger self-protection goals for low than high self-esteem people because risk generated more negative affect for lows. Accordingly, we reexamined the moderating effects of self-esteem observed in Experiments 2, 6, and 7 in analyses that also controlled for mood. All of the main effects of condition and the moderating effects of self-esteem remained significant.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="577" page="28" column="1">Optimizing Assurance by Regulating Risk</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="595" page="28" column="1">The present experiments provide strong and convergent support for the operation of the risk regulation system. When the external world signals risk, such experiences motivate people to seek safety through connection to their romantic partner (Path A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="578" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref>). The desire to seek connection then primes self-protection goals (Path C), triggering an executive control or stop– go system that tells people which specific situations are safe to approach (Path E). When operative, this control system directs low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, people away from situations of dependence in their relationships, frustrating the goal of seeking greater connection (Path H). When realities within the relationship itself signal risk, such experiences heighten the activation of self- protection goals (Paths B and D), resulting in distancing efforts that are evident both in people’s relatively more automatic associations to risk and in their behavioral intentions. Our model of the risk regulation process complements theoretical perspectives on both self-regulation and the mental represen- tation of interpersonal goals. In pursuing self-regulatory goals, low self-esteem people generally are more self-protective than highs— favoring those opportunities to affirm the self that seem safe (Baumeister, Tice, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="579" class="deo:Reference">Hutton, 1989</xref>; Heimpel, Elliot, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42" id="580" class="deo:Reference">Wood, 2006</xref>). For instance, low self-esteem people who desire interpersonal approval react to negative feedback about their likeability by wanting to appear more physically attractive to others but not by wanting to appear more warm—a more concrete and presumably safer means of self-enhancement (Park &amp; Crocker, in press). This article extends such logic by illustrating how self-protection can trump competing goal considerations for low self-esteem people in relationships. Consistent with our emphasis on the goal conflict inherent in specific relationship situations, attachment and social cognition researchers argue that goals are central to the content of significant-other representations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="581" class="deo:Reference">Collins &amp; Read, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60" id="582" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003</xref>). In fact, specific concrete goals, such as seeking support, being cooperative, or being smart, are activated automatically when significant-other representations are primed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="583" class="deo:Reference">Baldwin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="584" class="deo:Reference">Fitzsimons &amp; Bargh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="585" class="deo:Reference">Gillath et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78" id="586" class="deo:Reference">Shah, 2003</xref>). The current results extend this research by illustrating<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> how specific (risky) situations can prompt the association of the partner with conflicting goals. Aspects of the risk regulation model require refinement. Subsequent research could examine whether correction might be preempted if repeated experience with a partner in a specific situation has revealed little cause for concern. For instance, if Harry is consistently reassuring when Sally voices worries about her weight, this specific situation might cease to activate self- protection goals. Consequently, Sally’s willingness to seek out Harry for support in this domain might become automatic (and no longer require the safety check afforded by the risk regulation system). In contrast, if Harry is consistently critical when Sally expresses an opinion contrary to his own, such situations might cease to activate connectedness goals. Instead, Sally’s self- protective decision to keep such opinions to herself might become automatic, no longer requiring executive control to be enacted. Thus, examining how experience tailors risk regulation processes in repeatedly encountered situations remains an important task. Subsequent research might also examine whether the output of the risk regulation system is evident in behavioral responses that require less deliberative control. Recent research has suggested that people’s goal pursuits are evident in automatic evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29" id="588" class="deo:Reference">Ferguson, 2007</xref>). This raises the possibility that situations that involve dependence, such as seeking or providing support, might evoke different automatic responses as a function of executive strength. Risk might heighten positive implicit associations to support-seeking situations for both low and high self-esteem people when cognitively busy. However, when low self-esteem people have the executive strength necessary to correct, such situations might elicit negative implicit evaluations. Subsequent research might also examine the mechanisms internal to the control system, examining whether the “if . . . then” contingencies surrounding appraisal and signaling processes (Paths F and G in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="589" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref>) are more likely to be activated when executive strength is intact than when executive strength is usurped (as the model would anticipate). Subsequent research might also extend the risk regulation model to nonromantic relationship domains. Risk regulation dynamics should be most pronounced in relationships where two conditions are met: (a) Each partner’s dependence is volitional, and thus, each partner must make decisions about how much dependence to risk; and (b) rejection is painful because the value of the partner’s regard and caring cannot be not easily substituted for by another person’s. It is in such situations where people should need the greatest sense of assurance that seeking connection is not likely to result in rejection. Consequently, risk regulation dynamics might be more pronounced in relationships between parents and adult children or between best friends (DeHart, Murray, Pelham, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="590" class="deo:Reference">Rose, 2003</xref>) than in relationships between parents and young children or in relationships between casual friends or coworkers. Further research might also examine whether features of people’s working models that are not available to consciousness moderate risk regulation dynamics in ways that parallel the effects of consciously considered beliefs. Examining the moderating effects of implicit self-esteem could be particularly fruitful. For instance, people who are low on both implicit and explicit self- esteem might be so practiced in defending themselves against rejection that avoidance becomes an automatic response to risk. However, people with high implicit, but low explicit, self-esteem<marker type="page" number="29"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> may possess a hidden resilience that strengthens the activation of connectedness goals. In contrast, people with low implicit, but high explicit, self-esteem may possess a hidden vulnerability that strengthens the activation of self-protection goals (Jordan, Spencer, Zanna, Hoshino-Browne, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47" id="594" class="deo:Reference">Correll, 2003</xref>). Working models of self that convey such conflicting messages might then heighten goal conflict (because one system prioritizes connectedness, whereas the other prioritizes self-protection). Consequently, the relationship behavior of such individuals should be highly ambivalent, especially in situations where executive strength and, thus, the capacity to resolve such conflict are impaired.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="600" page="29" column="1">As being hurt is an inevitable part of romantic life, the challenge in maintaining a satisfying relationship rests in preventing such situated threats from impeding connectedness goals. However, for people with low self-esteem, the slightest offense is likely to be seen as a sign of impending rejection, motivating them to self- protect and distance themselves from the sting of any further perceived slights. Such efforts to minimize risk would be appropriate if people with low self-esteem actually possessed partners who valued and loved them less and treated them less well. This is not the case (Murray, Holmes, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67" id="597" class="deo:Reference">Griffin, 2000</xref>). Inappropriately calibrated attempts to self-protect may result in the people who most need to see signs of a partner’s acceptance behaving in ways that undermine the resource of an admiring partner that they need to preserve. For instance, women who chronically anticipate rejection behave more negatively toward their partner during conflicts and elicit more rejecting behavior in that specific instance (Downey, Freitas, Michaelis, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="598" class="deo:Reference">Khouri, 1998</xref>). Moreover, on days after rejection-sensitive women feel acutely rejected by their dating partner, their partner reports greater dissatisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="599" class="deo:Reference">Downey et al., 1998</xref>). In the diary study reported by Murray, Bellavia, et al. (2003), the spouses of people who felt less positively regarded (correctly) believed they were the target of more hurtful and rejecting behaviors on days after lows had felt most rejected—and it was only then that they actually became annoyed and rejecting toward their partner. By putting self-protection at a greater premium than connection, people who feel less positively regarded, such as those low in self-esteem, may create long-term interpersonal realities that de- feat their hopes and confirm their fears. Supporting this analysis, a longitudinal daily diary study of married couples suggested that the chronic activation of dependence-minimizing behaviors has a corrosive effect on relationships over time (Murray, Bellavia, et al., 2003; Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003). Specifically, men were more likely to become dissatisfied over the year when women’s behavioral response to feeling rejected was to self-protect and to behave negatively toward their spouse (Murray, Griffin, et al., 2003).</region>
