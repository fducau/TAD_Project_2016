      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="5" confidence="possible">Six studies examined the role of young adults’ parental attachment in terror management. Studies 1–3 revealed that activating thoughts of one’s parent in response to mortality salience (MS) reduced death-thought accessibility and worldview defense and increased feelings of self-worth. Studies 4 –5 demonstrated that MS led to greater ease of recalling positive maternal interactions and greater difficulty recalling negative interactions, and increased attraction to a stranger who was described as being similar to one’s parent. If reliance on parents for terror management purposes reflects the operation of attachment mechanisms, then such effects should vary on the basis of an individual’s attachment style. Study 6 demonstrated that, after MS, insecure individuals were more likely to rely on relationships with their parents, whereas secure individuals were more likely to rely on relationships with romantic partners.

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="7" page="1" column="1">Research on adult attachment over the past 2 decades has provided general support for Bowlby’s (1982) notion, based partly on Freud (1905/1957), that as people mature, their relationships with their romantic partners tend to take on many of the psychological functions formerly served by their relationships with their parents. The management of existential anxiety appears to be among these functions. A large body of evidence shows that close relationships serve a terror management function in that they help people cope with the awareness of the inevitability of death (Mikulincer, Florian, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83" id="6" class="deo:Reference">Hirschberger, 2003</xref>, 2004).

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="11" page="1" column="2">of the adult attachment literature, the extant research connecting terror management and attachment needs has focused extensively on romantic and other close peer relationships but not on the primary attachments that presumably form the impetus for later attachment representations. The present research explored the role that the original safe haven provided by one’s parents plays as an ongoing psychological bulwark against the problem of death. Drawing from terror management theory (TMT; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52" id="10" class="deo:Reference">Solomon, 1986</xref>), in six experiments we examined whether parental attachment, even in young adulthood, continues to serve existential needs.</region>

      </section>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="35" page="1" column="2">Despite somewhat different emphases, TMT and attachment theory share common roots (e.g., Freud, 1930/1939; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67" id="13" class="deo:Reference">Horney, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78" id="14" class="deo:Reference">Mead, 1934</xref>; Rank, 1929/1973; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115" id="15" class="deo:Reference">Sullivan, 1953</xref>) and provide com- plementary insights into the psychological processes that enable people to feel secure and manage their fears in a threatening world. Bowlby’s (1982) attachment theory posits that because the help- less infant’s survival is dependent on the care and protection of others, infants are predisposed to form attachment relationships with others (initially the parents) who offer care and protection against external threats (e.g., starvation). Thus, attachment theory views distress regulation as the primary impetus for the mainte- nance of the attachment bonds through which the child’s survival is assured. A substantial empirical literature accordingly demon-<marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> strates that individuals rely on attachment figures when faced with threat (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83" id="21" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003</xref>, for a review). TMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52" id="22" class="deo:Reference">Greenberg et al., 1986</xref>) posits that existential fear rooted in awareness of death is a primary source of distress and plays a central role in human motivation and behavior. The theory pro- poses that people manage this fear by securing self-esteem by believing in and living up to the standards of a cultural worldview that imbues life with meaning, order, value, and permanence. Empirical support for TMT is provided by converging evidence from over 350 experiments conducted in at least 15 countries testing variants of five basic hypotheses. This research has shown that (a) increasing self-esteem makes people less prone to anxiety in response to threats; (b) subtle reminders of death (mortality salience; MS) produce increased positive reactions to those who support one’s worldview and negative reactions to those who threaten it, increased self-esteem striving, and greater preference for information that is well-structured or fits specific templates for meaning; these effects have been obtained relative to a diverse array of control conditions; (c) increasing self-esteem or validating one’s worldview eliminates the effect of MS on self-esteem striving and worldview defense; (d) threats to self-esteem or one’s worldview increase the accessibility of death-related thoughts, and boosts to self-esteem or faith in one’s worldview reduce the accessibility of death-related thoughts; and (e) evidence of the existence of a literal afterlife eliminates the effect of MS on self-esteem striving and worldview defense. These effects have been observed across a multitude of different aspects of cultural worldviews and sources of self-esteem (for a recent review, see Greenberg, Solomon, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54" id="23" class="deo:Reference">Arndt, 2008</xref>). In the first presentation of TMT, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52" id="24" class="deo:Reference">Greenberg et al. (1986)</xref> briefly suggested a terror management function of close relationships due to the initial role of parents in offering protection from anxiety, and then later, the capacity of close relationships to bolster an individual’s self-esteem and faith in his or her cultural worldview (i.e., worldview validation). Integrating TMT and attachment theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84" id="25" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer and colleagues (2003, 2004)</xref> have argued that people pursue close relationships because they provide protection against existential concerns through a basic emotional attachment mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="26" class="deo:Reference">Bowlby, 1982</xref>), as well as by providing self-esteem and validation of one’s cultural beliefs. A considerable body of evidence supports this analysis. For example, reminders of death lead people to initiate interactions with other people (Taubman-Ben-Ari, Findler, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="27" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer, 2002</xref>), heighten feelings of personal competence and reduce fear of rejection (Taubman-Ben-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116" id="28" class="deo:Reference">Ari et al., 2002</xref>), and increase their desire for intimacy and commitment in romantic relationships (Florian, Mikulincer, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="29" class="deo:Reference">Hirschberger, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, death-related primes are among the types of threats that increase the accessibility of attachment constructs (Mikulincer, Gillath, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85" id="30" class="deo:Reference">Shaver, 2002</xref>) and having participants imagine either a separation from or argument with a romantic partner increases the accessibility of death-related thoughts and instigates worldview defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="31" class="deo:Reference">Florian et al., 2002</xref>; Mikulincer, Florian, Birnbaum, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82" id="32" class="deo:Reference">Malishkevich, 2002</xref>). Building from this research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61" id="33" class="deo:Reference">Hart, Shaver, and Goldenberg (2005)</xref> suggested that because close relationships, self-esteem, and cultural worldviews are developmentally intertwined, threats associated with one component of the security system result in compensatory activation of other components. Notably, although there is clear evidence<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> for the role of close relationships in terror management research, all of this research has focused on peer-to-peer relationships. Studies have yet to consider what role, if any, parental attachment plays in such processes.</region>

Such prototype-like dynamics have been advanced in the attachment literature by findings that, in adulthood, there is some degree of overlap between attachment security in parental and romantic domains (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="38" class="deo:Reference">Collins, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91" id="39" class="deo:Reference">Owens et al., 1995</xref>; Sroufe, Egeland, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113" id="40" class="deo:Reference">Kreutzer, 1990</xref>; van <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R120" id="41" class="deo:Reference">IJzendoorn, 1996</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40" id="42" class="deo:Reference">Fraley, 2002</xref>, for meta-analysis on attachment stability from infancy to adulthood). This idea has also been advanced in a variety of studies indicating that as people mature, their attachment to and use of parents for emotional security gradually diminishes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33" id="43" class="deo:Reference">Doherty &amp; Feeney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41" id="44" class="deo:Reference">Fraley &amp; Davis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49" id="45" class="deo:Reference">Furman &amp; Buhrmester, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64" id="46" class="deo:Reference">Hazan &amp; Zeifman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77" id="47" class="deo:Reference">Mayseless, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118" id="48" class="deo:Reference">Trinke &amp; Bartholomew, 1997</xref>), and their relationships with romantic and peer partners tend to take on many of the psychological functions formerly served by their relationships with their parents (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="49" class="deo:Reference">Allen &amp; Land, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="50" class="deo:Reference">Cassidy &amp; Shaver, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63" id="51" class="deo:Reference">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86" id="52" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer &amp; Goodman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="53" class="deo:Reference">Simpson &amp; Rholes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R122" id="54" class="deo:Reference">Weiss, 1986</xref>). Perhaps because of this, little attention has been paid in personality and social psychology to the influence of adult affectional ties to parents on psychological well-being across the lifespan. However, given that the relationship with one’s parents is the initial attachment bond that creates cognitive models posited to influence all later relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="55" class="deo:Reference">Bowlby, 1982</xref>; Freud, 1930/ 1939), the question of whether one’s parents continue to provide emotional security and buffer the existential concerns of the mature adult seems an especially important one for the continued integration of TMT and attachment theories. To the extent that parents represent the initial security bond, from a terror management perspective, they may remain helpful into adulthood when people need to allay their existential fears. In other words, if children’s relationship to their parents influences relationships and attachment in later life, and if affectional ties to the parents are an enduring bond across the lifespan, then such attachment may play a pivotal role in how adults manage existential concerns about their mortality. The results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84" id="56" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer and Shaver (2004)</xref> suggest that parents may indeed play such a role. Parents were more frequently nominated as attachment figures than other relationships, and traits associated with parents (like those associated with other relationships) were likely to be internalized as part of the self. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41" id="57" class="deo:Reference">Fraley and Davis (1997)</xref> found that a majority of their college-aged participants (60%) used their parents as primary attachment figures. However, in contrast to research examining the death-anxiety-buffering function of secondary attachment relationships (e.g., romantic partners, friends; for a review see<marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/>  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83" id="61" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer et al., 2003</xref>, 2004), to our knowledge the following experiments are the first to empirically explore whether people’s primary attachment to their parents also serve a terror management function in response to intimations of mortality. It is important to note that we are not suggesting that parental relationships uniquely serve terror management functions. The research cited in the preceding section is quite clear that close relationships (such as those with romantic partners or friends) are vital buffers against death-related cognition and play an important role in terror management processes. Rather, we suggest that an important question concerns whether for young adults, parents do so as well and therefore should be added to the lexicon of existential interpersonal resources. To provide initial insights into whether parental attachments serve terror management functions, we assessed three basic hypotheses. First, if parental attachment buffers death-related concerns, then rendering salient parental representations should reduce the defensive consequences of death reminders that would otherwise occur. To examine this possibility, we followed the strategy of previous TMT research. That is, previous research has established that self-esteem buffers the consequences of concerns about death by finding that situational boosts to self-esteem as well as opportunities to affirm valued aspects of the self reduce worldview defense and death-thought accessibility after MS (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="62" class="deo:Reference">Arndt &amp; Greenberg 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="63" class="deo:Reference">Florian et al., 2002</xref>; Harmon-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60" id="64" class="deo:Reference">Jones et al., 1997</xref>). Building from this literature and seeking to provide an understanding of how parental attachment can impact terror management processes, we examined in our first line of inquiry whether the activation of parental representations would attenuate MS induced death- thought accessibility (Study 1) and worldview defense (Study 2). Study 3 extended the analysis by exploring whether the accessibility of thoughts of a parent would be an important resource people could use to boost their self-esteem in response to mortality concerns. Following the approach of previous research on the effects of MS on self-esteem and close relationship striving (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32" id="65" class="deo:Reference">Dechesne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81" id="66" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer &amp; Florian, 2000</xref>; Taubman- Ben-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116" id="67" class="deo:Reference">Ari et al., 2002</xref>), we focused in our second line of inquiry on parental attachment as a potential psychological resource to which people may turn when reminded of their death. That is, if parents serve an anxiety-buffering function for their adult offspring, then people should be more positive toward their parents after MS. This basic idea was examined in Study 4, which assessed the effect of MS on participants’ ease or difficulty in recalling positive and negative interactions with their mother. Study 5 explored a further implication of the emerging theoretical synthesis of attachment theory and TMT (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61" id="68" class="deo:Reference">Hart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83" id="69" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer et al., 2003</xref>): that existential threat may affect evaluations of and interactions with others who share important characteristics with one’s parents. Specifically, we utilized Andersen’s (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="70" class="deo:Reference">Andersen &amp; Glassman, 1996</xref>) work on transference to examine people’s attitudes and behaviors following thoughts of death toward a person who was described as being similar or dissimilar to a parent. The final study (Study 6) explored the role of individual differences in attachment style in the way existential threats affect evaluations of parents. Specifically, contemporary re-<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> search on individual differences in attachment refers to two orthogonal dimensions: attachment-related anxiety and avoidance (e.g., Brennan, Clark, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="72" class="deo:Reference">Shaver, 1998</xref>). Research has consistently found that securely attached individuals (those scoring low on both dimensions), more than insecure persons, react to threats with an increased tendency to seek out close others for support (e.g., B. C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35" id="73" class="deo:Reference">Feeney &amp; Collins, 2001</xref>). This is also the case with regard to reactions elicited by reminders of death. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81" id="74" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer and Florian (2000)</xref>, secure persons reacted to MS with a heightened desire for intimacy in their romantic relationships, whereas anxious and avoidants persons did not (also see Taubman-Ben-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116" id="75" class="deo:Reference">Ari et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, making salient a romantic partner mitigated MS- induced worldview defense only for securely attached individuals. The lack of effects among those high in attachment anxiety may reflect the specific focus of prior research on adult attachments. Anxiously attached individuals may be unlikely to rely on adult relationships to cope with existential threat because they lack the ability to maintain secure adult attachments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63" id="76" class="deo:Reference">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987</xref>). Further, although parents and peers can accomplish the same anxiety-buffering function in young adulthood for secure individuals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33" id="77" class="deo:Reference">Doherty &amp; Feeney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41" id="78" class="deo:Reference">Fraley &amp; Davis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64" id="79" class="deo:Reference">Hazan &amp; Zeifman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118" id="80" class="deo:Reference">Trinke &amp; Bartholomew, 1997</xref>), more anxious individuals may rely on parents because they have problems transferring attachment functions to extrafamilial figures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="81" class="deo:Reference">Allen &amp; Land, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77" id="82" class="deo:Reference">Mayseless, 2004</xref>). Because no prior adult studies have compared preferences for the solace of different relationships after threat, in Study 6, we included such a comparison to assess the possibility that whereas romantic relationships best serve the terror management needs of securely attached adults, anxious adults will turn to parents when terror management is needed.</region>

To maintain the cover story, we included in all packets filler questionnaires and then, following previous research (Rosenblatt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99" id="92" class="deo:Reference">Lyon, 1989</xref>), we randomly assigned participants to answer questions related to either death or another aversive topic. In the MS conditions, the questions were “Please briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouse in you” and “Jot down, as specifically as you can, what you think will happen to you as you physically die and once you are physically dead.” In the control condition, participants were asked parallel questions about experiencing dental pain. This has been the most commonly used aversive thought control condition, and prior research has shown that it yields results similar to other aversive thought control conditions concerning topics, such as uncertainty, upcoming exams, and social exclusion, and similar to neutral control conditions as well (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70" id="93" class="deo:Reference">Landau et al., 2004a, 2004b</xref>; Routledge, Arndt, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70" id="94" class="deo:Reference">Goldenberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104" id="95" class="deo:Reference">Schimel et al., 1999</xref>).

Evidence suggests that distal MS effects occur when thoughts of death are highly accessible but outside of conscious awareness (Pyszczynski, Greenberg, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94" id="96" class="deo:Reference">Solomon, 1999</xref>). Therefore, we asked participants to complete the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R121" id="97" class="deo:Reference">Tellegen, 1988</xref>) and a word search task to provide a 3- to 5-min delay. The word search puzzle was a 10 10 matrix of letters with instructions asking people to search and circle 10 neutral words (e.g., book, movie). We used the PANAS in subsequent analyses to determine whether MS influenced people’s mood, although previous research indicates that it typically does not (see, e.g., Greenberg, Solomon, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55" id="98" class="deo:Reference">Pyszczynski, 1997</xref>). 2 Parent prime.

That is, write about a time when your mother was nonevaluative and simply accepted your for who you are.” In the negative condition, participants were instructed to consider a time where their mother held a “somewhat negative opinion” and “was very evaluative and accepted you only to the extent that you lived up<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> to certain standards.” As in Baldwin and Sinclair, participants in a third control condition were asked to write about a recent acquaintance (i.e., “someone you recently met”). Finally, we included a fourth condition wherein participants were asked to write about a positive interaction with a recent acquaintance. The instructions were identical to the positive parent condition except the word mother was replaced with someone you recently met. In all conditions, students were instructed to visualize being in the presence of this person (i.e., to imagine the person’s eye color, hair color, sound of his or her voice) and to express their thoughts and feelings associated with this person by writing for the length of a page. Death-thought accessibility. We used a word stem completion task to measure the accessibility of death-related thoughts; this served as the dependent variable. This task is similar to those used in other research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="100" class="deo:Reference">Bassili &amp; Smith, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51" id="101" class="deo:Reference">Gilbert &amp; Hixon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114" id="102" class="deo:Reference">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>; Tulving, Schacter, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119" id="103" class="deo:Reference">Stark, 1982</xref>) and presents participants with 25 word fragments, 5 of which could be completed with a neutral or death-related word.

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="121" page="5" column="1">Critically, as expected, there was no significant difference between MS and dental pain conditions after participants were primed with an accepting, positive mother (F 1). A third comparison was conducted to determine whether priming a critical, negative mother would similarly attenuate the activation of death-related thought (reflecting perhaps a global buffering effect of the attachment system) or whether only positive memories of one’s mother produce this effect. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, the results revealed that after being primed with a critical, negative mother, people in the MS condition completed more death-related words compared to the dental pain condition, F(1, 135) 11.23, p .001, d .92. A fourth comparison found that within the positive acquaintance condition, participants reported greater death-thought accessibility when primed with death (vs. dental pain), F(1, 135) 6.41, p .01, d .52. We also assessed the effect of parent primes within MS conditions. There was a significant difference among cells in the death, F(3, 135) 5.78, p .001, d .87, but not dental pain conditions (F 1). Within the MS condition, activating a positive, accepting interaction with one’s mother led to lower death-thought accessibility than a critical, negative interaction with one’s mother, and either a positive or neutral interaction with a recent acquaintance (Fs 2.97, ps .03, ds .71). No significant differences emerged between the negative parent and acquaintance conditions or between the two acquaintance conditions (Fs 1). Study 1 offers initial support for the hypothesis that positive cognitive representations of one’s parents provide a buffer against the increased accessibility of death-related thoughts produced by reminders of one’s mortality. When reminded of death, participants who were asked to think about a critical, negative interaction with their mother; a positive, accepting interaction with a recent acquaintance; or a neutral relationship with a recent acquaintance evidenced greater death-thought accessibility compared to those in other conditions. Impor- tantly, however, recalling an accepting, positive interaction with their mother reduced participants’ death-thought accessi- <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> bility. Taken together, these results provide some insight into how parents play a critical role in defending against existential concerns. Further, the current study clearly demonstrates that any positive relationship (i.e., an acquaintance) will not repro- duce the mitigation of death-thought accessibility, suggesting that the current results are not due to feelings of acceptance or positive thoughts in general. There are, however, a few issues with this study. One limi- tation involves the parent prime manipulation that was used. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="117" class="deo:Reference">Baldwin and Sinclair (1996)</xref> designed the visualization task to determine whether priming interpersonal acceptance or rejection is an important factor in the social construc- tion of self-esteem. Variants of this manipulation have subsequently been used to explore the consequences of different (intrinsic or extrinsic) contingencies of self-worth on general defensiveness (e.g., Arndt, Schimel, Greenberg, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="118" class="deo:Reference">Pyszczynski, 2002</xref>). This suggests that it is important to consider whether we were manipulating aspects of self-esteem rather than the salience of parental approval. But from a TMT perspective, positive feedback from the parent is an initial impetus for the development and desire for self-esteem (e.g., Solomon, Greenberg, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111" id="119" class="deo:Reference">Pyszczynski, 1991</xref>). Because evaluations from one’s parents are conceptually linked to self-esteem, teasing these variables apart would be exceedingly difficult. Therefore, in Studies 2 and 3, we adopted a different strategy for assessing the anxiety-buffering role of parents. First, instead of using a positively or negatively toned visualization task, participants were simply asked to write about a relationship with a parent. Second, unlike the previous experiments, participants were allowed to select which parent they chose to write about, allowing the opportunity to generalize results beyond the mother– child affectional bond. Another issue is that Study 1 did not compare the buffering effects of parental relationships to other attachment relationships. The present analysis posits that, like other close relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83" id="120" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer et al., 2003</xref>), parents continue to provide a terror management resource for their young adult children. However, we have yet to determine whether priming parental and other close attachment figures engenders similar effects within the same study.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="130" page="5" column="2">Similar to Study 1, participants were randomly assigned to write about their thoughts and feelings associated with death or, in this case, the control topic of losing a limb, to provide another elici- tation of a generally aversive cognition. In addition, as in the previous experiment, participants were randomly assigned to complete a visualization task in which they were asked to recall an interaction with a parent, an interaction with a close friend, or a neutral interaction with a recent acquaintance. The dependent measure asked people to evaluate a series of cultural transgressions, an approach that has been widely used in previous terror management research to assess worldview defense (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38" id="123" class="deo:Reference">Florian &amp; Mikulincer, 1997</xref>). Consistent with previous research (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55" id="124" class="deo:Reference">Greenberg et al., 1997</xref>), we predicted that MS, relative to an aversive control, would lead people to respond more negatively to cultural transgressions in the absence of a parent and close friend prime. In contrast, to the extent that parents and close friends fulfill<marker type="page" number="6"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> a terror management function, we hypothesized that making salient such relationships would eliminate these effects. Of course, a critical contingency of this hypothesis is that the parent and close friend do indeed function as an important attachment relationship for the individual. To provide a check on this assumption, we had participants complete a variant of the WHOTO scale; a measure that has been previously used to establish the attachment status of a relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41" id="128" class="deo:Reference">Fraley &amp; Davis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64" id="129" class="deo:Reference">Hazan &amp; Zeifman, 1994</xref>).</region>

Following a series of personality fillers, participants an- swered the same open-ended questions about death described in Study 1.

Because, as noted above, MS effects occur when death thoughts are highly accessible but outside current conscious awareness, we had participants complete the PANAS and a word search to provide a delay. Relationship manipulation. We used a modified version of the visualization task described in Study 1. First, instead of using a positively versus negatively toned visualization task, we randomly assigned participants to write about a particular relationship partner. Second, participants were allowed to select which parent they chose to write about, allowing the opportunity to generalize beyond the mother– child affectional bond. Specifically, in the parent condition, participants were told to “write about your parent or parent-like figure”; in the friend condition, participants were told to “write about your closest or best friend”; whereas in the neutral condition, participants were told to “write about someone you met recently.” With these exceptions, the instructions were otherwise identical to those used in Study 1. Worldview defense. The dependent measure was a modified version of Florian and Mikulincer’s (1997) Multidimensional Social Transgressions Scale consisting of four vignettes assessing reactions to both moral transgressions (i.e., an organizer running off with students’ tuition money, a burglar destroying an artist’s life masterpiece; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38" id="134" class="deo:Reference">Florian &amp; Mikulincer, 1997</xref>) and participants’ worldviews (i.e., an immigrant farm laborer criticizing the United States, students burning the American flag in protest; see also Cox, Goldenberg, Arndt, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29" id="135" class="deo:Reference">Pyszczynski, 2007</xref>).

To assess attitudes toward worldview threatening others, we averaged questions for the four transgression scenarios together to make a worldview defense score ( .74). WHOTO scale. To confirm whether parents and close friends serve as attachment figures, we had participants complete a modified version of the WHOTO scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41" id="137" class="deo:Reference">Fraley &amp; Davis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64" id="138" class="deo:Reference">Hazan &amp; Zeifman, 1994</xref>; also see J.

Specifically, participants were instructed to recall the person they were asked to write about earlier and answer a series of eight questions. Three questions tapped into the proximity-related function (e.g., “I like to spend time with my parent”), three items tapped into the safe-haven function (e.g., “I turn to my parent for comfort and support when I am upset”), and two items tapped into the secure base function (e.g., “I can always count on my relationship with my parent”). Instructions and questions substituted closest or best friend and someone you met recently for parent, depending on condition. For each statement, participants were asked to rate how much they agreed or disagreed on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 9 (totally).

As predicted and replicating many prior studies, MS (relative to losing a limb) increased defensive reactions to moral transgressors in the neutral acquaintance condition, F(1, 54) 6.46, p .01, d .60. In contrast, priming an interaction with a parent and a friend eliminated this effect (Fs 1). We also performed simple effects analyses within each level of the MS manipulation. After MS, participants primed with an acquaintance evidenced more negative responses to the transgressions than participants primed with either a parent or friend (both Fs 6.85, ps .02, d .70), but there was no significant difference between the parent and friend conditions (F 1). Within the control condition (losing a limb), there was no significant difference between relationships (Fs 1). The results of Study 2 provide additional support for the hypothesis that parents serve an anxiety-buffering function for their adult offspring. First, as expected, in the neutral relationship condition, MS led participants to favor a more punitive stance toward moral transgressions, a finding in line with previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29" id="154" class="deo:Reference">Cox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38" id="155" class="deo:Reference">Florian &amp; Mikulincer, 1997</xref>) examining worldview defense with such scenarios. Furthermore, as expected, asking people to visualize an interaction with a parent and a close friend eliminated this effect. Overall, these findings are important for three reasons. First, whereas Study 1 examined death-thought accessibility, this study extends the parental buffering effect to another well-documented consequence of MS (i.e., worldview defense). Second, whereas Study 1 only compared a parental prime to a recent acquaintance, here we were able to see that parents function similarly to other close relationships (e.g., a best friend).

Interestingly, research investigating possible direct effects of MS on self-esteem scores have yielded null or inconsistent results (e.g., Koole, Dechesne, &amp; van <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68" id="163" class="deo:Reference">Knippenberg, 2001</xref>; Sowards, Moniz, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112" id="164" class="deo:Reference">Harris, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70" id="165" class="deo:Reference">Pyszczynski et al.

This implies that when the need for self-esteem is increased by reminders of death, people will work especially hard to demonstrate their worth to both themselves and others, and will recruit whatever resources they have available to support positive feelings about themselves.

Further, including the separate subscales in the model did not affect the significant two-way interaction between MS and relationship primes on transgression scores (Fs 4.06, ps .02). Further, to determine whether more attached individuals reported less worldview defense after MS and the relationship primes, we examined within-cell correlations between the WHOTO and moral transgression scores.

To the extent that close relationships serve as a buffer against existential anxieties, activating parental and romantic relationships following reminders of death should lead people to feel secure and, thus, exhibit higher implicit feelings of self-worth.</region>

An assumption of the test is that strongly associated (compatible) attribute concept pairs (e.g., the concepts flower and pleasant) should be easier to classify together than weakly associated or opposed (incompatible) attribute concept pairs (flower and unpleasant). Strength of association is calculated by comparing one pairing (flower, pleasant) to another type of pairing (flower, unpleasant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57" id="184" class="deo:Reference">Greenwald et al., 1998</xref>). In the present study, IAT procedures were modeled closely after those used by Nosek and Lane (1999; also see Teachman, Gapinski, Brownell, Rawlins, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R117" id="185" class="deo:Reference">Jeyaram, 2003</xref>, for similar procedures with a pencil and paper version). 6 Practice trials were included to teach participants the IAT procedure. The task was explained as an attitudes questionnaire, and participants were told they would be categorizing words on the basis of category labels presented at the top of each page. Participants were informed that this was a timed task and instructed to work as quickly as possible while making as few errors as possible. They were also instructed to place their pen or pencil in a box at the top of the page and wait for the experi- menter’s signal to begin. Participants were presented with the category labels and words for the task and were asked to briefly study the words they would be classifying. Finally, they were told<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> to attend to the category labels presented at the top of each page because the categories changed from page to page. Once participants read the instructions and were ready to begin the IAT, the experimenter told them to turn to the next page. Half of the participants were presented with insect or bad (flower or good) first, and the other half were presented with insect or good (flower or bad) first. Participants were given 20 s to classify 40 words. When the experimenter said “stop,” participants were instructed to turn the page and place their pen or pencil in a box at the top of the next page and wait for the signal to begin classifying the words on that page. On this next page, participants classified words with the opposing category labels (again 20 s to classify 40 words). We counterbalanced the two tasks to eliminate order effects. Following the first IAT, participants were told to work through the remainder of the packet at their own pace. An example of the pen-and-paper-based version of the IAT can be obtained at www.briannosek.com. MS. Following a series of personality fillers, participants were randomly assigned to write about death or experiencing personal failure. We adopted failure to control for the threat of self-relevant aversive cognition, and it has been used in a number of prior terror management studies (e.g., Arndt, Greenberg, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="187" class="deo:Reference">Cook, 2002</xref>). Following the MS manipulation, we had everyone complete the PANAS Mood scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R121" id="188" class="deo:Reference">Watson et al., 1988</xref>) and a word search puzzle to provide a delay before assessment of the primary dependent measure.

However, rather than having people imagine a relationship with a close friend, we randomly assigned participants to write about a romantic partner, a parent, or, in the control condition, a recent acquaintance. In the romantic partner condition, participants were instructed to write about their “current or most recent romantic partner.” Implicit self-esteem.

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="198" confidence="possible" page="8" column="2">5 Although much of the research on attachment and self-esteem has relied on explicit self-report measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="190" class="deo:Reference">Bartholomew &amp; Horowitz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="191" class="deo:Reference">Collins &amp; Read, 1990</xref>; J.

First, as already noted, previous TMT research on the effects of MS on (explicit) self-esteem has produced mixed results (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68" id="194" class="deo:Reference">Koole et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112" id="195" class="deo:Reference">Sowards et al., 1991</xref>). Since the current study was looking at the intersection between attachment, terror management, and self-esteem concerns, we decided to use the IAT procedure. Second, in light of previous work that has found that explicit self-esteem is a poor predictor of people’s quality of relationship with their parents (see, e.g., Farnham, Greenwald, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34" id="196" class="deo:Reference">Banaji, 1999</xref>, for a review), the IAT was useful in the present study to determine whether adult children’s self-esteem is related to parental attachment. 6 Since the study was conducted in a classroom setting (i.e., 10 –15 students/session), we chose the pencil-and-paper-based version of the IAT because it could be administered to large groups of people at one time setting. Previous research on the similarities and differences between paper-and-pencil and computerized IAT tasks have found that the two measures are highly correlated with one another (r .91; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90" id="197" class="deo:Reference">Nosek &amp; Lane, 1999</xref>).</region>

Following procedures outlined above, participants were given two categorization tasks in which they were given 20 s to classify 40 words that were presented on a list on a single page with categorization instructions printed on both the left and right side of the column of critical words. For one of these categorization tasks, the left column asked participants whether the words were related to either self (myself, me, my, self, mine) or good (wonderful, smile, happy, joy, pleasure), and the right column asked participants whether the words were related to either other (other, they, their, them, theirs) or bad ( pain, grief, agony, sick- ness, terrible). For the second task, the combination was reversed so that participants were to categorize words as either self-related or bad on the left side of the page while also categorizing these same words as either other-related or good on the right side of the page. We counterbalanced the two tasks to eliminate any order effects. As with the practice IAT, participants were asked to work as quickly and accurately as possible, and they were told to try to avoid making mistakes (e.g., misclassifying a word) but to continue without stopping if this was to occur.

(2003)</xref>, we checked data to make sure that participants completed a minimum of five correctly identified items for each IAT page as evidence that they understood and attended to the task. Additionally, IAT pages were inspected for high error rates (i.e., 35% incorrectly classified items). Data for 2 women were excluded because of excessive errors, thereby bringing the total sample size down to 76 individuals. We calculated scores by counting the number of correctly classified words for each task (dropping all errors). 7 Thus, the variable of interest was the difference in the number of correctly classified items under the two category pairings (i.e., the compatible block [self good] minus the incompatible block [self bad]). Therefore, a higher score indicates higher feelings of self-esteem.</region>

There was no significant difference among the three relationships within the failure condition (Fs 1). As would be expected if attachment figures are important sources of self-esteem that are used to buttress self-worth when the need for protection from existential concerns is heightened, participants who were reminded of death and primed with thoughts of either their parents or romantic partners showed elevated levels of implicit self-esteem. In the absence of priming to increase the accessibility of these persons as sources of self-esteem, MS had no effect on implicit self-esteem. This is consistent with previous findings that self-esteem is not increased after MS without a basis for feeling better about oneself. Similarly, in the absence of MS, priming thoughts of attachment figures did not influence self- esteem. This suggests that the findings of Study 3 reflect a combination of increased need for self-esteem produced by the reminder of death coupled with increased resources for self-esteem provided by the accessibility of thoughts of an attachment figure. As with Study 2’s finding regarding the role of thoughts of close friends in deflecting the impact of MS on worldview defense, the effects of priming thoughts of one’s parents were equivalent to that of priming thoughts of another close relationship figure, in this case, a romantic partner.

From a TMT perspective, the more favorable the cognitions about a source of security, the more effective that source becomes as a buffer against existential fear. This need for positive parental representations should be especially great when one’s need for existential protection is elevated. Study 4 examined this possibility. Instead of using the parental visualization exercise as an independent variable as in Studies 1–3, here we used a variant of it as a dependent variable. After an MS manipulation, participants were asked to recall a positive, accepting interaction with their mother and a critical, negative interaction with her. Thus, we hypothesized that MS would bias people toward positive representations of their parents, making it easier to recall positive interactions with them and more difficult to recall negative interactions with them.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="262" page="11" column="1">The idea that ideation about early relationships with one’s parents may resurface in later relationships with others is common to a wide variety of psychological theories (e.g., attachment theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="245" class="deo:Reference">Bowlby, 1982</xref>; objects relations theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123" id="246" class="deo:Reference">Winnicott, 1960</xref>; social learning theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="247" class="deo:Reference">Bandura, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115" id="248" class="deo:Reference">Sullivan, 1953</xref>; attraction– similarity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="249" class="deo:Reference">Byrne, 1971</xref>). Of interest, the concept of transference, as originally proposed by Freud (1912/1958), refers to the phenomenon whereby aspects of past relationships with significant individuals resurface in and influence current interpersonal relations. More recently, Andersen and colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="250" class="deo:Reference">Andersen &amp; Baum 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="251" class="deo:Reference">Chen &amp; Andersen, 1999</xref>) have applied these ideas to interpersonal relationships and have developed methods for study- ing transference in the laboratory. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="252" class="deo:Reference">Chen and Andersen (1999)</xref>, when something about a new person reminds the perceiver of a significant other, the stored representations of the significant individual are readily accessible, either consciously or unconsciously and, in turn, are applied to the new person, thereby influencing the perceiver’s interpretations of and responses toward the new person.<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> In his analysis of what he referred to as “the spell cast by persons,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="254" class="deo:Reference">Becker (1973)</xref> built on Freud’s concept of transference and argued that other transference relationships play an important role in providing psychological protection against the awareness of death. He proposed that part of the reason people idealize meaningful others, including loved ones, leaders, and cult figures, is that they seek to use the power of others to protect them from existential fear. This implies that transference may be especially likely to occur when the problem of death is salient. Building on the work of Andersen and her colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="255" class="deo:Reference">Andersen &amp; Baum 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="256" class="deo:Reference">Chen &amp; Andersen, 1999</xref>), in the present study we examined reactions to a potential interaction partner as a function of MS and positive characteristics shared with a significant other, specifically, one’s opposite-gender parent. After being reminded of death (or not), participants were provided with a personality profile from an unknown partner with positive characteristics similar to either their own opposite-gender parent or someone else’s parent. Our primary reason for choosing the opposite-gender parent was simply to hold that variable constant. However, we also thought that this would be a good choice because it has sometimes been suggested that people tend to be attracted to members of the opposite sex with characteristics similar to their opposite-gender parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44" id="257" class="deo:Reference">Freud, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50" id="258" class="deo:Reference">Geher, 2000</xref>; Little, Penton-Voak, Burt, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72" id="259" class="deo:Reference">Perrett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73" id="260" class="deo:Reference">Little &amp; Perrett, 2002</xref>). We chose to examine the effect of shared positive characteristics because both attachment theory and the present Studies 1 and 4 show that it is positive parental representations that provide security and a buffer against death-related fear. Two primary dependent measures were assessed. First, we examined the participants’ attitudinal evaluation of their potential partner. Second, we obtained a behavioral measure of physical proximity seeking by using a variant of the seating paradigm developed by Macrae and colleagues (Macrae, Bodenhausen, Milne, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74" id="261" class="deo:Reference">Jetten, 1994</xref>). To the extent transference is especially likely to influence evaluations of others when existential threat is elevated, we hypothesized that MS would lead people to evaluate a target person who resembled their parent more positively and to sit closer to that person in an anticipated interaction task.</region>

Participants signed up for each study separately, and the studies were conducted at different locations on campus. The content and order of the materials for each session are described below. Session 1: Generating significant-other characteristics. Participants completed a questionnaire packet described as a personality and relationship assessment in a classroom setting. To obtain the characteristics for the second phase of the experiment, we <marker type="page" number="12"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> asked participants to provide information about their mothers and fathers. The actual purpose of this exercise was of course not revealed at the initial session. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="269" class="deo:Reference">Andersen and Baum (1994)</xref>, we told participants,<marker type="block"/> Participants were also asked to think about and generate a parallel set of sentences about their father. After listing these characteristics, they were asked to rank order each list in terms of their importance for distinguishing each parent from other people. The rank-ordered items were used to construct target descriptions for the partner evaluation task described in Session 2 (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="272" class="deo:Reference">Andersen &amp; Baum, 1994</xref>, we selected items ranked 4 –7 for the task). In addition to general trait characteristics, participants provided demographic information about both parents including age, date of birth, and general hobbies–interests; in addition, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="273" class="deo:Reference">Andersen and Baum (1994)</xref>, they were asked to evaluate 42 experimenter provided adjectives for each parent in order to get a reasonable number of irrelevant characteristics for the person perception task described in Session 2. At the end of the session, participants were asked to provide demographic information about themselves, including their age and gender. Session 2: Person perception. The actual experiment was conducted in a person perception study that was held at least 2 weeks after the initial session by a different experimenter. This phase of the experiment was conducted in individual sessions in a laboratory setting. These precautions (i.e., different experimenter, individual testing in a lab setting) were included to reduce the connection between the two sessions. Participants were told that the second study was interested in how people form first impressions about one another. The experimenter (who was blind to conditions) explained that the study involved filling out a couple of questionnaires and doing a task with a partner in another room (i.e., briefly talking with another student about a topic chosen at random, e.g., being in college). Participants were randomly assigned to complete one of two different questionnaire packets. The only difference between the packets was the MS manipulation. Personality profile. Participants were asked to complete a personality profile as part of the cover story for the experiment, and participants were told that they would be exchanging this information with their partner prior to the interaction task. The personality profile asked participants to answer a series of questions, including their birthday, major, interests– hobbies, and a few words to describe themselves. Mortality salience. Participants completed the same MS– dental pain and delay materials described in the previous studies. Partner evaluation. Participants were given a personality profile describing their fictitious partner in the next room. Half of the participants received a profile that resembled their own parent (women received a profile with characteristics that resembled their father, men received a profile with characteristics that resembled their mother) or someone else’s parent. In the own parent condition, the participant’s partner had the same birthday as his or her parent (i.e., the month and day but not year), participated in similar hobbies (i.e., two of the four<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> hobbies listed were similar to ones generated by participants in Session 1 to describe their parents), and read a series of characteristics used to describe the target person. As previously mentioned, these included the items ranked 4 –7 on their forms from Session 1. The remaining three characteristics were obtained from experimenter- supplied adjectives also collected at Session 1. In light of previous work that finds that people are able to discern a writer’s sex with better-than-chance accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62" id="275" class="deo:Reference">Hayes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102" id="276" class="deo:Reference">Sappington &amp; Money, 2003</xref>), the partner’s ostensible handwriting was designed to be consistent with the sex of the participant’s opposite-gender parent. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions prior to their participation, and separate experimenters were used to generate the personality profiles. Participants were then asked to evaluate their partner with the assurance that their partners would not have access to their evaluations. The dependent measure consisted of 12 items with scales ranging from not at all to totally, including, “How much do you think that you would like this person?” “In general, how positive is your impression of this person?” “How comfortable do you think you would feel interacting with this person?” and “How much are you looking forward to completing the task with your partner?” Similar to Study 4, responses were measured with a ruler. The possible range of scores was 1 to 16. We calculated partner evaluation scores by taking the mean response across all 12 items ( .91). Distancing task. Once participants finished their partner evaluations, the experimenter directed the participants into another room to complete the interaction task with their partner. This room was much larger than the previous lab space, and the room was completely empty except for two folding chairs left leaning against a wall. The experimenter informed the participant that she was going to check on his or her partner and asked the participant to set up the folding chairs for the task. When the experimenter returned, the participant was told that his or her partner was not ready and was asked to return to their original lab room to complete additional questionnaire forms. Once the participant had left the room, the experiment measured the distance (in inches) between the two chairs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74" id="277" class="deo:Reference">Macrae et al., 1994</xref>, for similar procedures). Manipulation checks. Participants completed two manipulation checks as part of the second questionnaire packet. First, to make sure that participants read their partner’s personality profile, we asked them to list four things that they remembered about their partner. Next, to determine whether their partner reminded them of their parent, we asked three questions, “Does your partner remind you of someone that you know?” “To what extent does this person remind you of your mother?” and “To what extent does this person remind you of your father?” Responses were indicated on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 9 (totally). These questions were analyzed separately for the manipulation check. At the end of the study, participants were extensively debriefed and probed about the nature of study and whether they saw any connection between the two separate sessions.</region>

A 2 (MS: death vs. dental pain) x 2 (target profile: own parent vs. other parent) between-subjects ANOVA on participants’ similarity ratings for the target person (i.e., “Does your partner remind you of someone who you know?”) revealed that no main or interaction effects were significant, Fs(1, 68) 2.13, ps .15. Since participants were presented with characteristics based on the gender of their parents (i.e., women received their father’s characteristics, men received their mother’s characteristics), separate analyses were performed on the remaining two items (“To what extent does this person remind you of your mother–father?”). For women, the ANOVA revealed a significant effect for profile, F(1, 43) 23.23, p .001, d 1.00, with people receiving their father’s characteristics stating the person resembled their father (M 5.04, SD 2.23) more than those who received someone else’s father characteristics (M 2.42, SD 1.47). Neither the main effect of MS nor the interaction between MS and parent profile was significant, Fs(1, 43) 1.29, ps .26. Similarly, for men, there was a main effect for profile, F(1, 21) 7.02, p .02, d .72, but no other effects (Fs 1). Examination of the means showed that men who received their mother’s characteristics (M 5.30, SD 1.70) rated the target as reminding them more of their mother compared to those who received another person’s mother descriptions (M 3.33, SD 1.91).

Simple main effect tests revealed a significant effect of MS within the parent-like condition, F(1, 70) 4.72, p .03, d .57, with people in the death condition moving the chairs closer together than the dental pain condition. There was no significant difference between death and dental pain conditions within the non-parent-like condition (F 1). The results also showed a significant effect of profile within the death, F(1, 70) 9.81, p .003, d .87, but not dental pain (F 1) condition. Following MS, participants who received parent-like descriptions moved the chairs closer together compared to those who received non-parent-like descriptions. Study 5 demonstrated that MS increased attraction and physical proximity to a novel person who shared positive characteristics with the participants’ opposite-gender parent. Because the effect of MS did not extend to a control other who resembled another person’s parent, it cannot be interpreted as a general increase in positivity of evaluations or proximity seeking brought on by the death reminder. Because this preference for others who resemble one’s parent did not emerge in the absence of MS, this result cannot be attributed to a general positivity effect of people viewing the characteristics of their parents as especially desirable. Rather, these results suggest that, as hypothesized, reminders of death increase the appeal of others who resemble one’s parents. Thus, transference reactions to those who share positive features with one’s parents appear to be especially likely when one’s need for existential protection is elevated. Presumably such others are especially attractive under conditions of MS because their similarity to one’s primary attachment figures implies, probably at an unconscious experiential level, that they will be comforting and esteem enhancing and thus useful for terror management purposes. Unlike the findings of Andersen and colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="293" class="deo:Reference">Andersen &amp; Baum, 1994</xref>), Study 5 did not find any hint of an effect of similarity to parent in the absence of MS.

We suspect that the similarity between parent and novel other in the present study may have been more subtle than that in these previous studies. For example, in Andersen’s work on transference (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="301" class="deo:Reference">Andersen &amp; Baum, 1994</xref>), partner characteristics are presented one at a time on an index card and participants are asked to memorize each trait for a memory test at the end of the study. Conversely, in the present study participants were simply asked to read a short personality profile about the target person. Although our participants did rate the transference target person as more similar to their parents than the control target person, they did not differentiate between target persons on the more subtle item asking if this person “reminds you of someone you know.” In contrast, Andersen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="302" class="deo:Reference">Andersen &amp; Baum, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65" id="303" class="deo:Reference">Hinkley &amp; Andersen, 1996</xref>) did find differences on measures similar to this item. This suggests that although transference processes may affect evaluations of those who are highly similar to important others in one’s life on a relatively routine and regular basis, heightened motivation may be necessary for transference effects to occur when the level of similarity between the novel other and transference object is relatively subtle. The present finding that transference effects are increased when mortality is salient are consistent with the ideas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47" id="304" class="deo:Reference">Freud (1958)</xref> and others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="305" class="deo:Reference">Becker, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115" id="306" class="deo:Reference">Sullivan, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123" id="307" class="deo:Reference">Winnicott, 1960</xref>) who posit that transference is often used to serve pressing and largely unconscious psychological needs. It is also generally consistent with theories that posit that romantic attraction to those who resemble one’s opposite-gender parent is driven by needs for psychological security (e.g., Freud, 1912/1958). And perhaps most relevant for present purposes, these findings support the attachment theory proposition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="308" class="deo:Reference">Bowlby, 1982</xref>; Brumbaugh &amp; Fraley, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63" id="309" class="deo:Reference">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987</xref>) that attraction to those who are similar to attachment figures is driven by the security and potential for a safe haven that such others provide.<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> The findings of Study 5 also raise some important questions worthy of additional research. Are these effects specific to reactions to members of the opposite sex who are similar to one’s opposite sex parent? Previous theorists from Freud on (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="311" class="deo:Reference">Daly &amp; Wilson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50" id="312" class="deo:Reference">Geher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72" id="313" class="deo:Reference">Little et al., 2003</xref>) have speculated about a possible romantic preference for those who share features with one’s opposite-gender parents, and the present study demonstrates that MS increases attraction to such others. The question of whether this effect would generalize to others who are similar to same-sex parents is an important one, but because it is not directly pertinent to the theoretical ideas the present set of studies was designed to test, it is not pursued further here. Second, because the current study only used positive trait adjectives to describe the target person, it is unclear what effect MS would have on evaluations of those who share negative characteristics with one’s parents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="314" class="deo:Reference">Andersen and Baum (1994)</xref> found a significant transference effect (evaluating a novel other who resembles an important person from one’s past in a way that reflects one’s feelings about the past other) regardless of whether the similarity was on positive or negative features. This suggests that the transference probably operates on both positive and negative dimensions. However, because our interest here was in MS- induced attraction to those who resemble attachment figures, and because Studies 1 and 4 demonstrate that only positive attachment representations are useful for terror management purposes, this question is beyond the scope of the present work and is not explored further here. Still, how people relate to others who share negative characteristics with attachment figures is an important and intriguing issue for future research on motivated transference processes.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="316" confidence="possible" page="14" column="2">STUDY 6: THE EFFECT OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN ATTACHMENT STYLE Study 6</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="324" page="14" column="2">Studies 1–5 provide converging evidence that parental attachment can play an important role in terror management processes. However, in Studies 2 and 3, both parental primes and close friend or romantic partner primes were found to mitigate the consequences of MS. This leads to the question of how parental attachment relates to other types of attachments and what leads a person to preferentially rely on one or the other type of attachment when his or her need for security is heightened. Although all attachment theories posit that the initial bond with one’s parents or primary caregivers forms the basis on which later relationships are founded, the present studies are the first to document the continued use of these primary attachment relationships to control existential anxiety in adult life. But given that young adults have now been shown to use their romantic partners, close friends, and parents as bulwarks against death-related anxiety, questions about the determinants of which others are selected for such protection must be addressed. As an initial step in this direction, Study 6 explored the role of attachment security in producing such preferences. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore relative preferences for different attachment figures in response to threat. After a copious literature search, we could find no studies that compared preferences for the solace of different relationship types <marker type="page" number="15"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> as a function of an individuals’ attachment style. Addressing this question poses a methodological challenge: How to assess participants’ relationship preferences among a number of simulta- neously available options. To this end, we created a purported marketing survey wherein participants were asked to allocate minutes on a cell phone calling plan to each of four different relationship persons (i.e., parent, sibling, romantic partner, close friend). Following previous TMT research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81" id="320" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer &amp; Florian, 2000</xref>), we hypothesized that low levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance (attachment security) would predict increased preference for close relationships with romantic partners. Conversely, after MS, insecurely attached individuals should report increased preference for a parent. However, we predicted that this effect would be specific to those with high levels of attachment anxiety and low levels of attachment avoidance, since previous research has found that such individuals have problems transferring attachment functions from parents to subsequent relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="321" class="deo:Reference">Allen &amp; Land, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77" id="322" class="deo:Reference">Mayseless, 2004</xref>). Highly avoidant individuals seem not to value attachments generally (Fraley, Davis, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="323" class="deo:Reference">Shaver, 1998</xref>), so we doubted whether they would rely on parents or any other attachment figures after MS.</region>

Participants completed Griffin and Bar- tholomew’s (1994b) 30-item Relationship Scales Questionnaire as part of a mass screening session approximately 2 weeks prior to their participation in the study. Previous research attests to the scale’s reliability and validity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58" id="328" class="deo:Reference">Griffin &amp; Bartholomew, 1994a</xref>, 1994b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69" id="329" class="deo:Reference">Kurdek, 2002</xref>).

Items were presented on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all like me) to 5 (very like me).

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="342" page="15" column="2">Separate regression analyses were performed on minutes allocated to each relationship (parent, romantic partner, sibling, and close friend). For each analysis, MS (dummy coded) and attachment anxiety and avoidance (centered) were entered simulta- neously as predictors in the first step, followed by all two-way interactions in the second step, and the three-way interaction in the third step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="339" class="deo:Reference">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>). To ensure participant’s relationship status did not affect the results, we included the amount of time in a romantic relationship (centered) as a covariate (entering zero for people not in a romantic relationship). Whereas there were no effects for time allocated to a close friend or sibling (both ps .21), there was an Avoidance Anxiety MS interaction on people’s time allocations to a romantic partner (b –16.58, SE 7.17, t –2.31, p .02, R 2 .18. In order to examine simple slopes, we needed to split the data; thus, we inspected the two-way interaction between MS and anxiety among those above and below the median on avoidance. There were no significant effects among high-avoidant individuals ( ps .34). However, there was an interaction between MS and anxiety among low-avoidant individuals (b 34.76, SE 9.94, t 3.50, p .001, R 2 .22; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" id="340" class="deo:Reference">Figure 7</xref>). Simple slope tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100" id="341" class="deo:Reference">Rosenthal &amp; Rosnow, 1985</xref>) revealed that, after MS, lower attachment anxiety predicted higher time allocations to a romantic partner (b –27.54, SE 8.46, t –3.25, p .002).

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="353" page="16" column="1">To further elucidate this interaction, we examined the effects of MS (vs. dental pain) at 1 SD above and below the mean on continuous attachment anxiety and avoidance scores (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="348" class="deo:Reference">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>). At high levels of attachment anxiety and low levels of attachment avoidance, reminders of death led to fewer minutes allocated to a romantic partner than did reminders of dental pain (b 50.47, SE 22.40, t 2.25, p .03). As expected, at low levels of anxious and avoidant attachment, however, MS increased the amount of time allotted to a romantic partner relative to the dental pain condition (b –16.38, SE 6.83), t –2.40, p .02). There was also an MS, anxiety, and avoidance interaction on parent time allocations (b 15.42, SE 5.66, t 2.73, p .01, R 2 .15. The Death Anxiety interaction was examined for those scoring above and below the median on avoidance, and the result revealed no significant effects among high-avoidant individuals ( ps .65). However, among low-avoidant individuals, the results revealed an MS Anxiety interaction (b –28.62, SE 7.07, t – 4.05, p .001, R 2 .32; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" id="349" class="deo:Reference">Figure 8</xref>). Simple slope tests revealed that, after MS, higher attachment anxiety predicted more time being allocated to a parent (b 26.71, SE 6.02, t 4.44, p .001). There was no linear relationship in the dental pain condition ( p .61). We again examined the effects of MS at 1 SD above and below the mean on attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance (both continuous). At high levels of attachment anxiety and low levels of attachment avoidance, MS participants allocated significantly more time to a parent than did their dental pain condition coun- terparts (b –32.04, SE 14.47, t –2.22, p .03). Experiment 6 provides initial evidence of the role of attachment style in determining which of several potential attachment figures one is most interested in interacting with after being reminded of their mortality. Specifically, those scoring low on attachment anxiety and avoidance (i.e., secure individuals) reported increased relative preference for a romantic partner (as measured by the amount of cell phone time allocated to this person) after MS than a control condition. In contrast, for those scoring low on avoidance and high on anxiety (i.e., highly anxious persons), MS led to an increased relative preference for a parent. Finally, there was no<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> significant relationship between MS and anxiety for those scoring high on attachment avoidance. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate how a person’s attachment style influences the preference for different attachment relationships in response to threat. In so doing, the study replicates, reconciles, and extends the previous studies reported here as well as in the prior work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81" id="351" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer and Florian (2000)</xref>. Whereas Mikulincer and Florian found that MS increased a desire for romantic relationship intimacy primarily among securely attached individuals, the present study replicates that finding but also shows that MS increased relational striving toward one’s parents among anxious individuals (i.e., people scoring high on attachment anxiety, low on attachment avoidance). By using a dependent measure that allowed participants to evaluate different relationships, we were able to see that the preferred object of relational strivings after MS differ in theoretically meaningful ways as a function of an individual’s preexisting levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance. One area of ambiguity concerns the responses of those scoring low on both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance (i.e., secure individuals). In this study, there was no effect of MS for such individuals on the amount of time allocated to a parent. In Studies 1–5, however, we found that parental representations generally served an anxiety-buffering function following reminders of death. One possible explanation for this apparent inconsistency is that the lower preference for parents in Study 6 could have been caused by secure individuals’ higher preference for romantic partners. Indeed, secure individuals on average allocated 79.45 of their 100 minutes to a romantic partner, leaving very few minutes to allocate to the other relationships (i.e., a parent, sibling, and/or close friend). In light of previous research that has found that secure persons react to MS with a heightened desire for close relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81" id="352" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer &amp; Florian, 2000</xref>), it makes sense that they would express an increased relative preference for a romantic partner over a parent when given the opportunity to do so. Although the current study provides the first step in examining people’s preferences for relationships as a function of MS and attachment style differences, future research should continue to examine when, where, under what circumstances, and for whom such preferences are more likely to occur.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="364" page="17" column="1">TMT has long posited that the capacity for self-esteem and cultural worldviews to protect people from fears about death develops out of the security provided by early attachment relationships.

The present series of studies addressed these questions.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="365" confidence="possible" page="17" column="1">Summary of the Main Findings</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="369" page="17" column="1">In the present work, we followed diverse strategies used in previous terror management research to uncover the psychological protection afforded by parental attachments. Specifically, the first series of studies tested whether parents serve an anxiety-buffering function. Study 1 showed that visualizing a positive interaction with a parent eliminated the delayed increase in death-thought accessibility otherwise produced by a reminder of one’s mortality. Study 2 showed that visualizing an interaction with a parent or a close friend eliminated the oft-replicated effect of MS on worldview defense. Study 3 revealed that combining MS and parent or romantic relationship primes led to increased feelings of self- worth. These studies thus attest to the capacity for parental representations to buffer the consequences of thoughts of death. The second series of studies examined specific ways in which people use their parents as a resource for managing mortality concerns. From a TMT perspective, the more favorable the evaluation of a source of security, the more effective that source becomes as a buffer against existential fear. In Study 4, MS increased the ease with which individuals were able to recall positive interactions with their mother and the difficulty they had recalling negative interactions with her. Study 5 demonstrated that MS led to increased (behavioral and evaluative) attraction to a stranger who was similar to one’s opposite-gender parent but had no effect on reactions to a positively described stranger who was not similar to one’s parent. Finally, Study 6 explored how variations in attachment style influence people’s reactions toward different personal relationships following MS. This study found that intimations of mortality motivated anxious individuals to show increased relative preference for a parent, whereas secure individuals showed increased preference for romantic partners. Taken together, the results of six studies, using markedly different approaches, suggest that adult offspring continue to use internal representations of their parents as a means of coping with the inevitability of death. From the perspective of attachment theory ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="366" class="deo:Reference">Bowlby, 1982</xref>), close relationships are important because they are an effective means for dealing with basic anxieties and as a resource for adjustment. The present findings converge with previous research (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83" id="367" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer et al., 2003</xref>) to extend these formulations to the existential fear of death. It seems that close relationships not only protect individuals from real or actual threats but also provide<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> a symbolic shield against reminders of one’s finitude. As the current research demonstrates, following MS, people are motivated to strengthen their relationship with a parent, who, in turn, may help them manage and diffuse the sense of threat. However, unlike most other threats, the threat of one’s mortality is inescap- able, and support from others cannot remove the threat entirely, though it can provide some comfort. That is, mere thoughts of failure (Study 3), pain (Studies 1, 4, 5, and 6), and loss of a limb (Study 2) can be easily dismissed because they can be viewed as unlikely to happen or experiences that people can move past, whereas thoughts of one’s mortality cannot be easily dismissed and death is not so surmountable. Therefore, whereas a number of aversive experiences when relevant are likely to activate the attachment system, the mere thought of them may not do so to the same extent as thoughts of death. In addition, in some of the present work (e.g., Studies 1–2), the control condition was not expected to elicit any defensive responses (e.g., worldview defense), and thus there was nothing for the activation of the attachment system to mitigate.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="370" confidence="possible" page="17" column="2">Issues With the Intersection Between Terror Management and Attachment</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="388" page="17" column="2">Although this work provides insight into the role of parental attachment in terror management, there are some remaining issues that should be noted. Although the present studies examined the role that parents play in buffering concerns about death, there are theoretical and empirical reasons to believe that attachment style would interact with MS to influence the findings (Studies 1–5). For example, one would expect individual differences in the ease with which people are able to recall positive interactions with their mothers, as well as the positivity of the interaction, and the vividness of the memory. Although we did not examine attachment-style differences in all of the studies, we feel that the current research is important because it integrates the normative (Studies 1–5) and intraindividual (Study 6) aspects of attachment. Hundreds of studies have documented the role of attachment in adulthood, focusing primarily on the domain of individual differences. The primary focus here was on the general role of parental attachment in coping with the threat of mortality. Still, Study 6 did support a moderating role of attachment style, suggesting that when given choices, securely attached people tend to rely on romantic partners, whereas anxious but not avoidant people tend to rely on parents. Further, whereas Studies 1 and 4 focused on perhaps the more basic maternal relationship, fathers can also serve as a source of meaning and security. Although Studies 2, 3, 5, and 6 explored people’s reactions to parent in place of one’s mother, we cannot confidently generalize all of the results to both parents. However, in Studies 2 and 3, we coded the relationship primes for whether people wrote about their mother or father and found that the gender of the parent did not affect the results. Future research should continue to explore when and how people use their fathers, in addition to their mothers, as a source of solace and protection against existential anxieties. Indeed, for certain individuals, fathers may have a more potent influence on attachment processes and psychological security (Shaver, Belsky, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105" id="371" class="deo:Reference">Brennan, 2000</xref>).<marker type="page" number="18"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> This distinction between parental attachments may be seen as part of a larger issue of how primary attachment fits into the matrix of young adults’ social networks. Studies have shown that under certain conditions, after reminders of mortality, people will seek generalized social affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125" id="375" class="deo:Reference">Wisman &amp; Koole, 2003</xref>), attitudinal consensus with larger nationalistic groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96" id="376" class="deo:Reference">Pyszczynski et al., 1996</xref>), commitment to romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="377" class="deo:Reference">Florian et al., 2002</xref>), and, now, parental attachment as well. However, what has yet to be explored are the conditions under which people seek the security of particular attachment representations over others. Study 6 provides an initial answer to this question, demonstrating that choice among relationships in response to threat depends on preexisting attachment styles, with securely attached persons showing increased preference for romantic partners, anxiously attached persons showing increased preference for parents, and avoidantly attached persons not showing any increased desire for contact with these persons or their siblings or close friends in response to MS. Although Study 6 provides an important first step toward exploring the determinants of preferences among different attachment figures in response to existential threat, more research is needed to explore the determinants of such relationship hierarchies and preferences. One can adopt an even broader vantage point and conceptualize attachment as one form of existential protection within a larger security system. In accord with this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61" id="378" class="deo:Reference">Hart et al. (2005)</xref> provided evidence of compensatory responses among attachment, self-esteem, and worldview defense mechanisms. The relative preference for utilizing these different resources, however, remains to be investigated. While there may indeed be a tripartite security system, it is likely that as people navigate through life, they prefer to use certain resources over others. Such preferences might vary depending not only on dispositional factors such as attachment style but situational factors as well. For example, one question is whether some types of threats may be more prone to elicit relational striving, whereas other threats may be more prone to elicit self-esteem or worldview relevant responses (Arndt, Greenberg, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="379" class="deo:Reference">Cook, 2002</xref>). Further, even within a type of threat, contextual factors may render a particular domain more appealing than others. Overall, in light of the results of Study 3 and that of other research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61" id="380" class="deo:Reference">Hart et al., 2005</xref>), more research is needed into the mechanism by which attachment buffers mortality concerns. The present analysis also provides a foundation from which to consider how the intersection between terror management and attachment relate to lifespan development. Attachment has been much studied as a theoretical concept explaining a child’s relational ties to his or her parents or caregivers; however, there have been relatively few empirical studies of attachment processes in adult children’s relationships and their aging parents (however, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="381" class="deo:Reference">Cicirelli, 1991</xref>), as well as the processes that unfold once the tables are turned and the child has children of his or her own. In regard to the former, one possibility is that given the increased vulnerability of parents to illness with increasing age, parents may indeed be more problematic and perceived less as attachment figures for their older children. Although Study 1 found that parents served an anxiety-buffering function for their adult children regardless of age (i.e., participants ranged in age between 17 and 54 years), we were unable to determine whether parents served the attachment needs (as assessed on the WHOTO) of our participants despite age<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> differences. A second possibility is that watching one’s parents grow old and approach death might actually increase the salience of one’s mortality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70" id="383" class="deo:Reference">Martens, Greenberg, Schimel, and Landau (2004)</xref> can be seen as consistent with this view. In this research, similar to reactions to disabled persons observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66" id="384" class="deo:Reference">Hirschberger, Florian, and Mikulincer (2005)</xref>, exposure to elderly persons increased death thought accessibility among younger individuals, and reminding younger adults of their mortality resulted in distancing from and derogation of elderly people. Of course, there may be important differences between typical elderly persons and one’s parents in terms of their capacity to stimulate thoughts of personal mortality and associated existential dynamics. Perhaps because of the existential protection they provide, in many cases people seem reticent to accept their parents’ aging and increasing vulnerability to mortality. And when such revelations are made, do they also prompt concerns with personal mortality and its consequent defensive reactions? It is worth noting that, while not focused on one’s parents per se, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53" id="385" class="deo:Reference">Greenberg et al. (1994)</xref> found that thoughts of the death of a loved one did not elicit as strong an effect on worldview defense as thinking about one’s own mortality. Nonetheless, by drawing attention to existential issues and parental attachment, the present studies invite further inquiry into the conditions under which (and the interaction between) parents’ capacity to serve as anxiety buffers and reminders of the transience of life across the lifespan. Just as there are important questions to consider when people approach the end of life, so too are there critical questions about the juxtaposition of terror management and attachment as new life begins. Research is needed to explore the existential and attachment dynamics that emerge when children become parents. Wisman and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61" id="386" class="deo:Reference">Goldenberg (2005)</xref> found that reminders of mortality can increase the desire for offspring, as long as the desire for offspring was not seen by participants as inconsistent with pursuing career choices that might garner prestige and self-esteem. This finding invites consideration of how people juggle the different motives that reminders of death can provoke. The integration of attachment style into this topic (e.g., Rholes, Simpson, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98" id="387" class="deo:Reference">Friedman, 2006</xref>), in turn, may help to elucidate how people prioritize different terror management motives across the changing landscape of one’s life- time.</region>

Previous attachment research in personality and social psychology has predominately focused on people’s relationships with their romantic partners (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="391" class="deo:Reference">Bartholomew, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63" id="392" class="deo:Reference">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59" id="393" class="deo:Reference">Griffin &amp; Bartholomew, 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83" id="394" class="deo:Reference">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2003</xref>; Shaver, Hazan, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106" id="395" class="deo:Reference">Bradshaw, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108" id="396" class="deo:Reference">Simpson, 1990</xref>).

        <region class="unknown" id="532" page="22" column="1">Members of Underrepresented Groups: Reviewers for Journal Manuscripts Wanted If you are interested in reviewing manuscripts for APA journals, the APA Publications and Communications Board would like to invite your participation. Manuscript reviewers are vital to the publications process. As a reviewer, you would gain valuable experience in publishing. The P&amp;C Board is particularly interested in encouraging members of underrepresented groups to participate more in this process. If you are interested in reviewing manuscripts, please write to the address below. Please note the following important points: • To be selected as a reviewer, you must have published articles in peer-reviewed journals. The experience of publishing provides a reviewer with the basis for preparing a thorough, objective review. • To be selected, it is critical to be a regular reader of the five to six empirical journals that are most central to the area or journal for which you would like to review. Current knowledge of recently published research provides a reviewer with the knowledge base to evaluate a new submission within the context of existing research. • To select the appropriate reviewers for each manuscript, the editor needs detailed information. Please include with your letter your vita. In the letter, please identify which APA journal(s) you are interested in, and describe your area of expertise. Be as specific as possible. For example, “social psychology” is not sufficient—you would need to specify “social cognition” or “attitude change” as well. • Reviewing a manuscript takes time (1– 4 hours per manuscript reviewed). If you are selected to review a manuscript, be prepared to invest the necessary time to evaluate the manuscript thoroughly. Write to Journals Office, American Psychological Association, 750 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002-4242.</region>
