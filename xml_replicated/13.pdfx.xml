      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="5" confidence="possible">A variety of experimental evidence indicates that the memory representation for multiplication facts (e.g., 6 9 54) incorporates bidirectional links with a forward association from factors to product and a reverse association from product to factors. Surprisingly, the authors did not find evidence in Experiment 1 of facilitative transfer-of-practice from multiplication (6 9 ?) to factoring (54 ? ?); in fact, multiplication practice produced item-specific interference with factoring. Similarly, the authors found no evidence in Experiment 2 that repetition of specific factoring problems (54 ? ?) facilitated performance of corresponding multiplication problems (6 9 ?). In Experiment 3, participants practiced both multiplication and factoring and presented facilitative transfer in both directions. Thus, bidirectional facilitation occurred if both operations were practiced, but interference occurred when only one operation was practiced. We propose that this seemingly paradoxical behavior occurs because it is adaptive for the bidirectional retrieval structure to retain operational flexibility in the context of practicing both operations, whereas it is adaptive to specialize the memory representation for the practiced operation (i.e., factoring or multiplication) when only one operation is practiced.

The main theoretical goals have been to characterize the representations, retrieval processes, and procedural strategies that subserve elemen- tary math (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="7" class="deo:Reference">Ashcraft, 1992</xref>, 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="8" class="deo:Reference">Campbell &amp; Xue, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="9" class="deo:Reference">LeFevre, Sadesky &amp; Bisanz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="10" class="deo:Reference">Zbrodoff &amp; Logan, 2005</xref>). Understanding these basic skills is important because numeracy is an increasingly pervasive requirement of modern life and because cognitive number processing provides a constrained and tractable domain for developing detailed theoretical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="11" class="deo:Reference">Butterworth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="12" class="deo:Reference">Campbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="13" class="deo:Reference">Dehaene, 1997</xref>). This article reports three experiments that pursued predictions of a prominent theory of arithmetic fact representation: the identical elements (IE) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="14" class="deo:Reference">Rickard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="15" class="deo:Reference">Rickard &amp; Bourne, 1996</xref>; Rickard, Healy, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="16" class="deo:Reference">Bourne, 1994</xref>; see also Campbell, Fuchs-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="17" class="deo:Reference">Lacelle &amp; Phenix, 2006</xref>).

      </section>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="42" page="1" column="2">The principles of the IE model originate in Edward L. Thorndike’s seminal work of the early 20th century in which he argued that transfer of learning was restricted to training and test conditions with identical elements (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="23" class="deo:Reference">Singley &amp; Anderson, 1989</xref>, for an excellent overview of Thorndike’s transfer research). Applying IE principles to mental arithmetic, Rickard et al. (1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="24" class="deo:Reference">Rickard &amp; Bourne, 1996</xref>) proposed that there is a single memory node for arithmetic facts composed of identical elements (i.e., operands and answer) regardless of operand order. For example, each multiplication node specifies the two operands, the operation, and the product (e.g., [6, 8, 3 48]) and is accessed by either operand order (6 8 or 8 6). In contrast, problems that present different operands and have different answers access different nodes. Thus, inverse division problems (e.g., 48 8 and 48 6) are represented by different nodes ([48, 8, 3 6] and [48, 6, 3 8]). Rickard and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="25" class="deo:Reference">Rickard &amp; Bourne, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="26" class="deo:Reference">Rickard et al., 1994</xref>) conducted a series of transfer-of-practice experiments that supported the basic IE model. These showed that repeated practice of specific problems produced positive transfer (i.e., response time [RT] savings) between identical pairs (e.g., 6 8 and 6 8) that was practically equivalent to that between commuted pairs (e.g., 8 6 and 6 8). This result supports the assumption that a common representation mediates both orders of commuted multiplication pairs (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="27" class="deo:Reference">Verguts &amp; Fias, 2005</xref>). In contrast, Rickard and colleagues found no transfer of savings between the two orders of<marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> division problems (practice 56 7 8, test 56 8 7) and little evidence of facilitative transfer in either direction between division and multiplication (practice 7 8 56, test 56 8 7, or practice 56 8 7, test 7 8 56). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="32" class="deo:Reference">Campbell et al. (2006)</xref> demonstrated that the IE model also applies to addition and subtraction: There is virtually complete transfer across commuted addition pairs composed of identical elements (e.g., 6 8 14 and 8 6 14) but practically no transfer between inverse subtraction pairs (e.g., 14 – 6 8 and 14 – 8 6). Nonetheless, other transfer experiments testing simple multiplication and division indicated that the original IE model was not sufficient. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="33" class="deo:Reference">Campbell (1999)</xref> used a transfer paradigm that measured the effects of a single prime problem on a probe problem tested a few trials later. There were transfer effects not predicted by the IE model, including significant transfer of savings between the two orders of division problems. Additionally, the larger, more difficult division problems presented substantial RT savings in the multiplication-to-division transfer condition (e.g., prime 7 9, probe 63 7). Campbell proposed that transfer between order- reversed division problems and between multiplication and division could be reconciled with the IE model by distinguishing associative transfer (i.e., savings from strengthening a common problem node) from mediated transfer (i.e., savings from strengthening a related, mediator problem). Mediation involves solving a problem (e.g., 63 7 ?) by reference to a closely related problem (e.g., 7 9 63 or 63 9 7). Because mediated performance depends on the accessibility of the mediator, strengthening of the mediator produces RT savings (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="34" class="deo:Reference">LeFevre &amp; Morris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="35" class="deo:Reference">Mauro, LeFevre &amp; Morris, 2003</xref>). To accommodate evidence of mediated transfer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="36" class="deo:Reference">Rickard (2005)</xref> introduced a revised IE model (IE-r), which distinguishes between asymptotic IE representations and nonasymptotic IE representations. When memory strength for a fact representation is near asymptote, then performance will be mediated by direct retrieval, and transfer effects will reflect IE principles. When memory strength is below asymptote, then transfer effects might be mediated (e.g., division facilitated by strengthening the mediating multiplication fact). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="37" class="deo:Reference">Campbell et al. (2006)</xref> showed that inter- operation transfer between division and multiplication was observed only when trials reportedly solved by procedural strategies were included for analysis. When analysis included only trials for which participants reported direct memory retrieval, there was little evidence of inter-operation transfer. Thus, consistent with the IE-r model, inter-operation transfer between division and multiplication apparently depends on mediational strategies that are used when direct memory retrieval is not supported. Rickard’s (2005) IE-r model also specified the mechanism by which multiplication mediates division. Rickard proposed that, in addition to providing a forward association from factors to products (e.g., 7 5 35), the IE representation of multiplication facts also provides the reverse association from the product (e.g., 35) to its factors (7 and 5). The reverse association can mediate division when the required division fact is below asymptote. For example, presentation of 56 7 would activate the reverse association from 56 to 7 and 8, with the unique element (8) reported as the quotient. In two experiments, Rickard showed that university students are, in fact, very efficient at factoring (i.e., stating the factors given the product) and that practicing specific factoring<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> problems (30 ? ?) produced facilitative transfer to the corresponding multiplication fact (5 6 ?). Rusconi, Galfano, Rebonato, and Umilt ` (2006) provided converging evidence for the reverse association in multiplication. Rusconi et al. used the number matching task introduced by LeFevre, Bisanz, and Mrkonjic (1988; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="39" class="deo:Reference">Thibodeau, LeFevre &amp; Bisanz, 1996</xref>) in which participants are flashed a pair of cue digits (e.g., 2 4) and then must decide if a subsequently presented target number matches one of the cue digits. Response times are relatively slow if the target is the product (i.e., 8), as compared with an unrelated number (e.g., 7). This suggests that multiplication problems can automatically activate the product, which interferes with a no-match decision. Rusconi et al. showed that this interference effect is also observed in the reverse direction (e.g., cue 8, target 2 4) and concluded that multiplication facts incorporate bidirectional links that provide both a forward and a reverse association. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="40" class="deo:Reference">Rickard (2005)</xref> pointed out that the reverse association would develop for multiplication facts but would not be likely to develop for addition facts. This asymmetry would occur because, for the single-digit multiplication facts, most products are associated with a unique pair of factors (e.g., 27 with 3 and 9) or two pairs of factors (24 with 3 and 8, or 4 and 6), whereas sums generally do not map onto unique addends. Consequently, practicing multiplication would establish both forward and reverse associations, but practicing addition would not. Without a reverse addition association to mediate subtraction, it follows that addition-based mediational strategies should be relatively infrequent for subtraction. Consistent with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="41" class="deo:Reference">Campbell et al. (2006)</xref> observed inter- operation transfer in both directions between corresponding simple multiplication and division, but no inter-operation transfer of savings between addition and subtraction.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="56" page="2" column="2">The reverse association is supported directly by two different experimental methodologies ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="44" class="deo:Reference">Rickard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="45" class="deo:Reference">Rusconi et al., 2006</xref>) and also neatly explains the complex pattern of facilitative transfer effects observed in simple arithmetic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="46" class="deo:Reference">Campbell et al., 2006</xref>). In the present study, we sought converging evidence for the reverse association using a different transfer paradigm from that employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="47" class="deo:Reference">Rickard (2005)</xref>. In Rickard’s transfer study (Experiment 1), participants received 40 practice blocks of alternating factoring problems (8 ? ?) and multiplication problems (3 4 ?). During the subsequent multiplication test phase, participants received the items practiced by factoring (i.e., practiced 8 ? ? then tested on 2 4); the practiced multiplication problems; and new, unpracticed multiplication problems. Relative to new problems, factoring facilitated corresponding multiplication problems substantially; improvement was 59% of that observed from practicing multiplication. Thus, factoring appeared to strengthen the corresponding multiplication fact, although not as much as practicing multiplication. Rickard argued that the same memory structure is strengthened by factoring or multiplying but that there are also operation-specific processes that are strengthened, which results in larger savings for the same operation than if there were an operation change at test. In Experiment 1, we attempted to extend the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="48" class="deo:Reference">Rickard (2005)</xref> transfer results using a pretest–practice–posttest design. Rickard examined inter-operation transfer from factoring to multiplication<marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> only, but the IE-r model predicts that there also should be transfer from practicing multiplication to factoring. Therefore, in Experiment 1, we examined effects of practicing multiplication (2 7 ?) on performance of the same problem (2 7 ?) and performance on the corresponding factoring problem (14 _ _ ?). One group of participants performed multiplication during the pretest and posttest, and the other group performed factoring. Both groups practiced only multiplication during the practice phase. During the pretest and posttest, three experimentally defined problem sets were tested: practiced problems (composed from a subset of four factors, either 2, 4, 7, 8 or 3, 5, 6, 9), unrelated problems (composed from the factor set not used for the practiced problems), and related problems (composed of one factor from the practice set and one not used for the practice set). During the practice phase, participants received 15 continuous blocks of the practice set presented as multiplication problems. This pretest–practice– posttest design allowed us to measure transfer from multiplication practice to the same multiplication problem and to the corresponding factoring problem, with the unrelated problems providing a control baseline. The related problems could be informative as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="52" class="deo:Reference">Phenix and Campbell (2004)</xref> demonstrated that multiplication fact retrieval is subject to retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). RIF is the phenomenon whereby repeated retrieval of a subset of items results in increased retrieval difficulty for related items that were not practiced (Anderson, Bjork, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="53" class="deo:Reference">Bjork, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="54" class="deo:Reference">Anderson &amp; Green, 2001</xref>; Anderson, Green, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="55" class="deo:Reference">McCulloch, 2000</xref>). Similarly, Phenix and Campbell found that repeatedly practicing some members of a times-table family (e.g., 7 2, 7 3, 7 4,. . .7 9) resulted in slower response times for other members of the family. Thus, comparing related and unrelated problems at posttest was expected to provide a measure of RIF in this experiment.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="62" page="3" column="1">The experiment consisted of three phases, including a pretest, practice, and posttest. There were two pretest and three posttest blocks in which all 21 multiplication problems were presented in a random order. During the pretest and posttest, participants in the factoring group received the product (e.g., 56) and typed in the corresponding factors (7 8) in either order. Multiplication participants received the factors (7 8) and typed the correct product (56). Odd or even participant number determined assignment to the factoring or multiplication group. During the practice phase, participants received 15 continuous blocks of seven practice-set problems, in random order, presented as multiplication problems. Among the 21 problems tested in the pretest and posttest phases, there were the seven practice-set problems, seven unrelated problems composed from operands not used for the practice set, and <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> seven related problems that included one operand used for the practice set. To create these sets, seven problems were composed from the factors 2, 4, 7, and 8 (8 4 2, 14 7 2, 28 7 4, 32 8 4, 49 7 7, 56 7 8, 64 8 8) and seven others from the factors 3, 5, 6, and 9 (15 5 3, 25 5 5, 27 9 3, 30 6 5, 45 9 5, 54 9 6, 81 9 9). Assignment of these two sets to the practice and unrelated conditions was counterbalanced across participants. Practice and unrelated problems were unrelated in virtue of sharing no common factor. Seven related problems were composed that contained one factor that appeared in the practice set and one that did not appear in the practice set. All participants received the same related problem set, which included 6 3 2, 10 5 2, 20 5 4, 21 7 3, 42 7 6, 48 8 6, 72 9 8. Although absolute performance on the related set cannot be compared with the practice and unrelated sets because of the possibility that the related set differs in difficulty from the other two, changes in performance for the related set between pretest and posttest can be meaningfully interpreted (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="61" class="deo:Reference">Phenix &amp; Campbell, 2004</xref>). Multiplication problems always appeared with the larger factor on the left. All problems were presented horizontally in white characters against a dark background. Characters were approximately 3 mm wide by 5 mm high.</region>

An IBM-type computer was used, with two high-resolution monitors to display stimuli. The researcher sat behind the participant, and each viewed a separate monitor. The instructions for the task emphasized both speed and accuracy. Factoring participants were instructed to use the numbers 2 through 9 as factors and were informed that factor order did not matter. Participants entered their responses using the number pad on the computer keyboard. RT was measured from stimulus onset to the final keystroke. To begin each trial, a fixation dot appeared in the center of the screen for 1 s, then flashed twice. The problem appeared on what would have been the third flash. Multiplication problems occupied a seven-character field (e.g., 7 2), with the multiplication sign at fixation. For factoring problems, the stimulus (e.g., 14) appeared with the leftmost character at fixation. The problem remained on the screen until the participant had completed their response. Presentation of problems within each block was continuous, but participants received a short break after the pretest–posttest and practice phases. Participants did not receive feedback about speed or accuracy.</region>

The median of log RTs for correct trials were analyzed with a 2 3 2 ANOVA, with variables of group (multiplication or factoring), problem type (practiced, unrelated, related), and test phase (pretest or posttest). The antilogs of the mean median RTs appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="76" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref>.

The only significant effect in the ANOVA was the three-way interaction of group, problem type, and test phase, F(2, 52) 6.60, MSE 3,822.54, p .003. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="78" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref> shows that practicing a subset of multiplication problems (i.e., the practiced problem set) facilitated multiplication of those problems in the posttest relative to the pretest (373 ms), but multiplication practice interfered with the corresponding factoring problems ( 165 ms). Thus, instead of the expected facilitation effect, multiplication practice produced robust interference for the corresponding factoring problems. A comparison of the related and unrelated problems provided a test for RIF; specifically, if related problems were inhibited during practice, we would expect negative transfer for related relative to unrelated problems. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="79" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref> suggests that unrelated problems presented some RT savings relative to related problems in the posttest block. A separate 2 2 2 ANOVA that compared RT for the unrelated and related problem sets as a function of group and test phase (last block of pretest vs. first block of posttest) provided weak evidence for a Test Phase Problem Type interaction, F(1, 26) 3.23, MSE 5,369.9, p .08. This trend persisted into the second posttest block, however, and the Test Phase Problem Type interaction was statistically robust when both posttest blocks were included, F(1, 26) 6.22, MSE 4,980.8, p .019 (RT savings of 245 ms and 11 ms for the unrelated and related sets, respectively). RT savings for the unrelated problems presumably would arise from participants globally speeding up in the posttest relative to the pretest (with commen- surate accuracy costs; see following error analysis). Relatively less speed-up for the related problem set would occur if related problems were inhibited during the practice phase (i.e., RIF). There<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> was no evidence of a three-way interaction in the main analysis of related and unrelated problems, F(1, 26) 0.64, MSE 5,369.9, p .43. Thus, the significant three-way interaction in the overall ANOVA was attributable primarily to the opposing effects of multiplication practice on the multiplication practice set (facilitation) and factoring practice set (interference).</region>

Mean percentage of errors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="83" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref>) received a 2 3 2 ANOVA, with variables of group (multiplication or factoring), problem type (practiced, unrelated, related), and test phase (pretest or posttest). As in the analysis of RT, there was a triple interaction of group, problem type, and test phase, F(2, 52) 6.15, MSE 96.5, p .004. Again, practiced multiplication problems presented facilitation, with error rates dropping from 15.3% at the end of pretest to 2.0% at the beginning of the posttest. As in the RT analysis, the corresponding factoring problems encountered interference, with errors increasing from 9.2% in the pretest to 17.3% in the posttest. In a separate error analysis that included only the related and unrelated problems, only the Test Phase Problem Type effect was significant, F(1, 26) 6.16, MSE 75.69, p .02. Errors on unrelated problems increased in the posttest relative to the pretest, whereas related problems tended to produce fewer errors in the posttest (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="84" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref>). The increase in errors for unrelated problems presumably represents a speed–accuracy tradeoff associated with global speed up in the posttest (see preceding RT analyses). The opposing trend toward reduced errors on related problems in the posttest could be a consequence of RIF. RIF is expected to inhibit related problems (i.e., other problems in the same times table; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="85" class="deo:Reference">Phenix &amp; Campbell, 2004</xref>), but this could facilitate accuracy for problems in the related set by inhibition of their semantic competitors. RIF would thereby slow related set RT (see preceding RT analysis) but reduce related set errors. There was no evidence</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="94" page="5" column="1">Participants in the factoring group performed as quickly and accurately as participants in the multiplication group, even during the pretest. This is consistent with participants entering the experiment already in possession of accessible representations for factoring. Multiplication practice produced strong facilitation for the practiced multiplication problems both in terms of RT and accuracy. Thus, the practice phase clearly was effective in strengthening the practiced multiplication facts. In contrast, multiplication practice disrupted performance of the corresponding factoring problems at posttest. This appears to be contrary to the hypothesis that multiplication practice should strengthen a bidirectional retrieval structure that subserves both multiplication and factoring. There was some evidence in the RT analysis that performance of related problems also encountered interference relative to unrelated problems, but there was no evidence that this differed between the factoring and multiplication groups. This pattern raises the possibility that multiplication practice inhibited RT for other items in the same times table, which would be consistent with previous evidence of RIF in simple multiplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="93" class="deo:Reference">Phenix &amp; Campbell, 2004</xref>). As this trend was statistically equivalent for the factoring and multiplication groups, it follows that RIF affected both factoring and multiplication. This would be consistent with the view that factoring and multiplication utilize the same retrieval structure. Nonetheless, Experiment 1 clearly failed to find that multiplication practice facilitated factoring for the corresponding problems; indeed, multiplication practice (7 8 ?) interfered with the corresponding factoring problem (56 ? ?). This negative transfer is opposite the facilitation expected if practicing one direction of the bidirectional retrieval structure facilitated its processing in both directions. Before considering how the current findings might be reconciled with Rickard’s (2005) transfer evidence for the reverse association, it is important that we first try to reproduce inter-operation transfer in the direction tested by Rickard (i.e., factoring to multiplication). In Experiment 1, we examined transfer from multiplication practice to factoring. Therefore, Experiment 2 repeated the basic design and procedure of Experiment 1 except that participants practiced factoring during the practice phase. On the basis of the IE-r model and results of Rickard (2005, Experiment 1), we expected factoring practice (e.g., 56 ? ?) to facilitate performance of the corresponding multiplication problems (8 7 ?).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="120" page="6" column="1">Experiment 2 constituted a conceptual replication of Rickard (2005, Experiment 1) in which practice of factoring produced substantial facilitation to performance of the corresponding multiplication problems. Here, the factoring problems that were practiced sped up by about 300 ms between the pretest and posttest, which demonstrates that the practice phase was effective in facil- itating the practiced problems. The corresponding multiplication problems, however, presented no evidence of facilitation. In fact, related multiplication problems appeared to encounter RT interference from factoring practice. Thus, Experiment 2 provided no evidence that factoring strengthened a retrieval structure that facilitates both factoring and multiplication. Taken together, the results of Experiments 1 and 2 seem to present a paradox when considered in relation to Rickard’s (2005) Experiment 1. How can we reconcile the opposing negative and positive transfer patterns presented by the two paradigms? Given the failure of both Experiments 1 and 2 to produce the transfer pattern expected on the basis of the hypothesis of the reverse association, we designed Experiment 3 as a close replication of Rickard (2005, Experiment 1), which demonstrated facilitative transfer from factoring to multiplication. Unlike Experiments 1 and 2 in the present experiment, in Rickard’s paradigm, participants practiced both factoring and multiplication problems in the practice phase. At test, transfer to corresponding multiplication problems was measured relative to new, unpracticed problems. We extended the design to include a second group of participants to examine facilitative transfer from multiplication to factoring.</region>

Instructions explained both the multiplication task and the factoring task while emphasizing both speed and accuracy. For the factoring task, participants were instructed to enter the operands in any order but to avoid using repeated factors (e.g., 16 2 8 but not 4 4) or the one rule (i.e., 1 the presented number). Participants did not receive feedback about speed or accuracy. 2 For all participants, the experiment began with 40 practice blocks, with operation (factor or multiply) alternating across blocks. Even-numbered participants began practice with multiplication, and odd-numbered participants began with factoring. Eight problems were presented per block, resulting in a total of 320 practice trials. There was a brief break between practice blocks, and a screen message indicated the operation for the upcoming block. After completing the practice phase, participants received all three sets of problems (i.e., multiplication practice, factoring practice, and new) in a test phase. During the test phase, half of the participants performed factoring, and the other half performed multiplication. Each of the 24 problems was presented in random order in each of four test blocks.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="165" page="8" column="1">The purpose of these experiments was to seek converging evidence for the reverse association in simple multiplication fact retrieval. In previous research, both a practice-transfer paradigm ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="158" class="deo:Reference">Rickard, 2005</xref>) and a matching-task paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="159" class="deo:Reference">Rusconi et al., 2006</xref>) provided evidence for a direct associative link from product (8) to factors (2 4). Furthermore, given that the reverse association would provide a mechanism for performing simple division, the reverse association theory provided an explanation for positive transfer from multiplication to corresponding division problems. In contrast, we would not expect a corresponding reverse association for simple addition facts because there are not comparable unique mappings of sums to addends as there are products to factors. Accordingly, we would not expect subtraction to be mediated by addition, and there is no evidence of transfer of practice between corresponding addition (4 3 ?) and subtraction (7 3 ?) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="160" class="deo:Reference">Campbell et al., 2006</xref>). Our Experiment 3, which used Rickard’s (2005) transfer paradigm, confirmed positive transfer from factoring to corresponding multiplication problems and extended Rickard’s results by showing that the paradigm also produced positive transfer from multiplication practice to corresponding factoring problems. Taken together, the collective evidence for a reverse association mechanism in simple multiplication seems strong. It might appear to be paradoxical, then, that our Experiments 1 and 2 failed to find positive transfer evidence of the reverse association, in terms of either facilitation from factoring to multiplication or facilitation from multiplication to factoring. Nonetheless, in both Experiments 1 and 2, participants performed factoring just as quickly and accurately as multiplication. Thus, participants pre-experimentally possessed representations and processes that permitted efficient factoring performance. Furthermore, in Experiment 1, the interference effect from multiplication practice on<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> factoring was not global but instead primarily affected the corresponding factoring problems. This item-specific negative transfer between corresponding factoring (15 ? ?) and multiplication (5 3 ?) problems in Experiment 1 provides additional strong evidence that the same retrieval structure mediated both. Thus, although our paradigm for Experiments 1 and 2 produced an inter-operation transfer pattern that was opposite that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="162" class="deo:Reference">Rickard (2005)</xref>, the results nonetheless reinforce the IE-r theory of a bidirectional retrieval structure for multiplication facts. The central question is why do the two transfer paradigms yield opposing transfer patterns? One important procedural difference between the paradigms is that Rickard’s (2005) Experiment 1 participants practiced both factoring and multiplication during the practice phase, whereas in our Experiments 1 and 2, participants practiced only one operation. This difference could have several consequences relevant to the opposing transfer patterns observed. In consideration of this, it is useful to introduce a distinction between the long-term memory (LTM) retrieval structure (i.e., the multiplication fact representation) and the cognitive procedures that retrieve relevant information from it (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="163" class="deo:Reference">Pirolli &amp; Anderson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29" id="164" class="deo:Reference">Zbrodoff &amp; Logan, 1990</xref>). Zbrodoff and Logan coined the term microprocess to refer to the LTM representation of a multiplication fact and the term macroprocess to refer to task-specific procedures that operate on the microprocess. In this view, factoring and multiplication stimuli activate distinct production rules that extract different components from the same LTM retrieval structure. For factoring, the product serves as a retrieval cue for the factors, whereas for multiplication, the two operands are retrieval cues for the product. The different input structures (e.g., 56 vs. 7 8) require distinct encoding processes to map the stimulus to the common internal structure and different answer- retrieval processes to extract the appropriate components for respond- ing. Thus, each hypothetical macroprocess would be specialized to handle the task-specific encoding, information extraction, and response requirements of each operation. The macroprocess implements a production rule that applies generally to an entire arithmetic operation; thus, changes in the efficiency of executing the macroprocess affect the entire operation. We assume that practicing a specific problem facilitates processing both the macroprocess (i.e., increases the fluency of extracting factors or products) and the microprocess</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="174" page="9" column="1">(i.e., strengthens the bidirectional associative link between the product and factors). In Rickard’s (2005) Experiment 1 and our Experiment 3, we expected practice to facilitate application of both the factoring and the multiplication macroprocesses, because both operations were extensively practiced. As participants cycled through 40 practice blocks of a few factoring problems alternating with a few multiplication problems, their skilled ability to flexibly execute either macroprocess would increase. 4 The greatest post-practice benefits at test would accrue for identical items (e.g., practice 8 9 72 and test 8 9 72 or 9 8 72), which benefit from the strengthening of specific microprocess–macroprocess combinations. Corresponding problems in the other operation (e.g., 72 ? ?) would also show facilitation relative to new problems because the independent contributions of strengthening the relevant microprocess (e.g., through multiplication practice) and the relevant macroprocess (e.g., through factoring practice on different problems) combine to yield positive transfer. In contrast, in our Experiments 1 and 2, participants practiced only one operation (factoring or multiplication) during the practice phase. The specific items practiced (i.e., microprocess– macroprocess combinations) would be strengthened and present savings at test, as observed. However, when there was an operation change at test (i.e., practice 9 8 ?, then test 72 ? ?; practice 72 ? ?, then test 9 8 ?), the relevant macroprocess had not been practiced and, consequently, there was no potential benefit from applying a well-practiced macroprocess, as in Rickard’s paradigm. In fact, practicing the application of one macroprocess (i.e., factoring or multiplying) to the exclusion of the other leads to item-specific interference during subsequent at- tempts to apply the unpracticed macroprocess. This negative transfer was most clear in Experiment 1, where multiplication practice produced substantial RT and accuracy costs for corresponding factoring problems. This suggests that exclusively practicing one operation resulted in specialization of the fact representation to accommodate the practiced macroprocess, perhaps by inhibition of the other direction of association (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="170" class="deo:Reference">Singley &amp; Anderson, 1989</xref>, p. 116). When the unpracticed macroprocess was subsequently applied to the modified fact representation, its efficiency to process that structure was reduced. This interference was sufficiently strong to overwhelm the potentially positive benefits of strengthening the bidirectional representation. According to this account, item-specific interference between factoring and multiplication occurs when only one operation is practiced (Experiments 1 and 2) because the item’s retrieval structure becomes tailored to the practiced direction of retrieval to the determent of the unpracticed direction of retrieval. When both macroprocesses are practiced, however (even on different fact representations, i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="171" class="deo:Reference">Rickard, 2005</xref>, Experiment 1 and our Experiment 3), then operation-specific tailoring of the fact representation does not occur. Consequently, there is no negative transfer between operations and facilitative effects of strengthening the shared memory representation can appear. This complex behavior may be understood as an adaptive response to the different task environments created by the two paradigms. In the context of mixed practice of the two operations, it would be adaptive to retain the flexibility to apply either macroprocess. This view is consistent with evidence that increasing the contextual variety of problems during practice can improve trans-<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> fer to unpracticed items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="173" class="deo:Reference">Schmidt &amp; Bjork, 1992</xref>). If only one operation is practiced, however, then in that context it becomes adaptive to specialize the microprocess representations to maxi- mize performance of the practiced operation. This results in item- specific interference when the unpracticed macroprocess is applied at test.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="178" page="9" column="2">Three experiments tested the IE-r theory of number fact representation and provided new evidence that multiplication facts entail a bidirectional retrieval structure that affords multiplication or factoring. The important new theoretical contribution of this work has been to show that processing of that retrieval structure is subject to dynamic influences that can affect its processing in seemingly contradictory ways. In two transfer paradigms that are isomorphic with respect to theoretically basic design features (i.e., practice subset of problems in one or the other operation, test same problems and corresponding problems in other operation), the results were in surprising opposition, producing positive transfer in one case and negative transfer in the other. The apparent resolution of this seemingly paradoxical behavior lies in recognizing that the learning system engaged during practice adapts to the variability in processing requirements that the practice phase presents. In the context of mixed practice of factoring and multiplication, it is adaptive to retain the flexibility to apply either macroprocess. In combination with the strengthening of the bidirectional representation, this leads to item-specific facilitation across operations at test. When only one operation is practiced, however, it is adaptive to specialize the memory representation for that operation, perhaps by inhibiting the reverse direction of processing. This results in item-specific interference when the unpracticed operation is attempted at test. The paradigm- dependent behavior of the bidirectional retrieval structure thereby arises from its adaptiveness to the learning and performance context. This observation, in addition to informing cognitive arithmetic theory and educational practice, is also relevant more broadly because such adaptiveness likely is pervasive in human learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="176" class="deo:Reference">Anderson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="177" class="deo:Reference">Schmidt &amp; Bjork, 1992</xref>).</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="181" confidence="possible" page="9" column="2">4 We would expect some global speed-up owing to improved fluency with each macroprocess.
