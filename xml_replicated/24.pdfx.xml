      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="8" confidence="possible">Results from 2 relational-priming experiments suggest the existence of an automatic analogical coordination between semantic and arithmetic relations. Word pairs denoting object sets served as primes in a task that elicits “obligatory” activation of addition facts (5 3 activates 8; J. LeFevre, J. Bisanz, &amp; L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="5" class="deo:Reference">Mrkonjic, 1988</xref>). Semantic relations between the priming words were either aligned or misaligned with the structure of addition (M. Bassok, V. M. Chase, &amp; S. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="6" class="deo:Reference">Martin, 1998</xref>). Obligatory activation of addition facts occurred when the digits were primed by categorically related words (tulips– daisies), which are aligned with addition, but did not occur when the digits were primed by unrelated words (hens–radios, Experiment 1) or by functionally related words (records–songs, Experiment 2), which are misaligned with addition. These findings lend support to the viability of automatic analogical priming (B. A. Spellman, K. J. Holyoak, &amp; R.

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="16" page="1" column="1">Arithmetic competence is considered to be a highly specialized subarea of human cognition. An impressive body of work has examined the origins and the development of arithmetic competence, the computational strategies used by children and adults, and the way people represent numbers and arithmetic facts (for an edited volume of review chapters, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="9" class="deo:Reference">Campbell, 2005</xref>). Most theoretical accounts of arithmetic competence hold that adults retrieve well-practiced arithmetic facts from long-term memory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="10" class="deo:Reference">Ashcraft &amp; Battaglia, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="11" class="deo:Reference">Campbell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="12" class="deo:Reference">Dehaene &amp; Cohen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="13" class="deo:Reference">Geary &amp; Widaman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41" id="14" class="deo:Reference">McCloskey, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47" id="15" class="deo:Reference">Siegler, 1987</xref>).

Just as words spread activation to semantically related concepts (e.g., nurse primes doctor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42" id="22" class="deo:Reference">Meyer &amp; Schvaneveldt, 1971</xref>), so do digits spread activation to arithmet- ically related facts (e.g., 5 3 activates 8; LeFevre, Bisanz, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="23" class="deo:Reference">Mrkonjic, 1988</xref>). There are many good conceptual and pragmatic reasons for investigating the unique aspects of arithmetic knowledge and skill. However, this line of research has not taken account of the fact that, by and large, people use arithmetic knowledge in the context of solving real-life problems. In the applied context, people coordinate their knowledge of arithmetic operations with their knowledge about the entities in the target situations (e.g., 4 girls 2 boys 6 children; 12 cookies/6 children 2 cookies per child). As we elaborate later, prior work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="24" class="deo:Reference">Bassok, Chase, and Martin (1998)</xref> suggests that this coordination involves analogical alignment of semantic and arithmetic relations, or semantic alignment. In the above example, the categorical relation between girls and boys is aligned with addition, and the functional relation between cookies and children is aligned with division. Bassok and her colleagues found that people adhere to semantic alignments when they reason about mathematical word problems (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="25" class="deo:Reference">Bassok, 2001</xref>). In the next section, we present some illustrative examples from this prior work. Then, we report results from two relational priming experiments in which pairs of word primes that were semantically aligned and misaligned with addition modulated automatic activation of addition facts. In the General Discussion section, we suggest that the semantic and the arithmetic memory networks do not just share analogous representations of interrelated concepts but are actually coordinated with each other via analogous semantic and arithmetic relations.</region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="51" page="1" column="2">People have extensive experience with mathematical applications, whether they are solving problems in their everyday life (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="28" class="deo:Reference">Carraher &amp; Schliemann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45" id="29" class="deo:Reference">Saxe, 1988</xref>) or solving math-<marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> ematical word problems in school (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43" id="34" class="deo:Reference">Nesher, 1989</xref>). In both contexts, people use their mathematical knowledge to model quantitative relations between various entities and, therefore, have to draw on their world knowledge to constrain problem formulation, solution, and verification (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="35" class="deo:Reference">English &amp; Halford, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="36" class="deo:Reference">Greeno, 1987</xref>; Hegarty, Mayer, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="37" class="deo:Reference">Monk, 1995</xref>; Hinsley, Hayes, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="38" class="deo:Reference">Simon, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34" id="39" class="deo:Reference">Kintsch, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35" id="40" class="deo:Reference">Koedinger &amp; Nathan, 2004</xref>). In doing so, people’s world knowledge sometimes conflicts with the formal properties of mathematics, leading to systematic errors (e.g., Bassok, Wu, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="41" class="deo:Reference">Olseth, 1995</xref>). However, the very existence of such errors demonstrates people’s strong tendency to coordinate their mathematical knowledge with the rest of their conceptual knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="42" class="deo:Reference">De Corte &amp; Verschaffel, 1996</xref>; Fischbein, Deri, Nello, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="43" class="deo:Reference">Marino, 1985</xref>). Bassok and her colleagues found that people coordinate their semantic and arithmetic knowledge by aligning semantic relations between the objects that appear in word problems with analogous mathematical relations (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="44" class="deo:Reference">Bassok, 2001</xref>). 1 The work that is most directly relevant to the studies reported here pertains to semantic alignments for the arithmetic operations of addition and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="45" class="deo:Reference">Bassok et al., 1998</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="46" class="deo:Reference">Bassok et al. (1998)</xref>, people align categorical semantic relations with the operation of addition because categorically related objects play identical roles with respect to their joint superset (e.g., both tulips and daisies are flowers), just as the addends play identical (com- mutative) roles with respect to their sum (a b b a c). In a complementary way, people align functionally asymmetric object relations, such as “contain” (e.g., flowers are contained in vases rather than vice versa), with the noncommutative relation between the dividend and the divisor (a/b b/a). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="47" class="deo:Reference">Bassok et al. (1998)</xref> found that college students, who have extensive experience with the application of arithmetic operations, adhere to semantic alignments when they construct arithmetic word problems. In one experimental condition, participants received word pairs denoting object sets and were asked to construct simple addition word problems involving these sets. When presented with categorically related sets (e.g., plums and peaches), which are aligned with addition, participants mainly constructed problems in which the sets were directly added to each other (e.g., 5 plums 4 peaches 9 pieces of fruit). However, when they were presented with functionally related sets (e.g., plums and baskets), which are misaligned with addition, participants re- frained from constructing such direct-addition problems. Instead, they used a variety of “semantic escape” strategies, such as in- venting a third object set (e.g., pears) and constructing more complex word problems that preserved semantic alignment (e.g., [5 plums 3 pears]/2 baskets 4 pieces of fruit per basket). The complementary pattern was obtained when the task was to construct division rather than addition problems, whereby participants constructed more direct-division problems for functionally related than for categorically related sets. A similar pattern of semantic alignments was found when college students solved unfamiliar permutation word problems (Bassok et al., 1995), and when middle school, high school, and college students solved division word problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="48" class="deo:Reference">Martin &amp; Bassok, 2005</xref>). Such effects are consistent with people’s extensive experience with problems involving arithmetic applications. Although we do not have empirical data about the frequency of semantic alignments in every-day problems, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="49" class="deo:Reference">Bassok et al. (1998)</xref> provided such<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> data for a large corpus of textbook word problems. They found that, in all cases, the arguments of addition were categorically related objects (e.g., red and blue marbles; toads and frogs). At the same time, in 96% of the cases, the arguments of division were objects related by functionally asymmetric relations (e.g., marbles and boxes; frogs and ponds).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="55" page="2" column="2">People’s extensive experience with semantically aligned applications of arithmetic operations, and the robustness of semantic alignments in people’s reasoning about word problems, strongly suggest that such alignments are highly automatic. The present study was designed to examine this possibility for the most basic and most practiced arithmetic operation of addition. To this end, we conducted two experiments in which we examined whether pairs of word primes, which are either semantically aligned (e.g., tulips– daisies) or semantically misaligned with addition (e.g., birds– cages), can modulate automatic activation of addition facts (e.g., 3 4 7). 2 For our experiments, we adapted the number-matching task that LeFevre and colleagues used to demonstrate that pairs of digits lead to “obligatory” (unintentional) activation of simple addition facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="53" class="deo:Reference">LeFevre et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37" id="54" class="deo:Reference">LeFevre &amp; Kulak, 1994</xref>). In one version of their number-matching task, people see a pair of cue digits that are related by the plus sign (e.g., “5 3”). They then see a single digit target and have to decide whether the target matched one of the cue digits. When rejecting nonmatching targets (i.e., when the correct answer is “no”), people take longer to reject “sum” targets (in this case, an “8”) than to reject nonsum or “neutral” targets (e.g., “9”). Henceforth, we refer to this pattern of results as the sum effect. We preceded the pairs of cue digits with pairs of priming words that were either semantically aligned or semantically misaligned with addition. The aligned primes denoted categorically related sets (e.g., tulips– daisies). The misaligned primes denoted unrelated sets (e.g., hens–radios) in Experiment 1 and denoted functionally related sets (e.g., birds– cages) in Experiment 2. Because categorical primes provide an appropriate relational context for the application of addition, they should support automatic activation of addition facts and lead to the typical sum effect. The unrelated and functionally related primes, by contrast, provide an inappropriate relational context for the application of addition. We therefore reasoned that these primes should reduce or block automatic activation of addition facts and, therefore, diminish or eliminate the typical sum effect. On the basis of the above logic, we predicted that the sum effect would be more pronounced in the semantically aligned than in the semantically misaligned priming condition. That is, we predicted</region>

At present, there is no evidence that documents similar effects for division. We therefore restricted our initial investigation to the operation of addition. In light of our findings, it seems worthwhile to extend the present investigation to the operation of division. We return to this point in the General Discussion section.</region>

It is important to note that the logic of our experimental design presupposes the viability of relational priming. Spellman, Holyoak, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48" id="60" class="deo:Reference">Morrison (2001)</xref> found that, under an appropriate strategic set, semantic relations prime analogous semantic relations. In the General Discussion section, we compare the present findings with those of Spellman et al. We propose that the process that mediates the coordination between the semantic and the arithmetic memory networks is similar to the process that mediates analogical access (Forbus, Gentner, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="61" class="deo:Reference">Law, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="62" class="deo:Reference">Hummel &amp; Holyoak, 1997</xref>).</region>

According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="65" class="deo:Reference">Bassok et al. (1998)</xref>, unlike categorically related sets that preserve a one-to- one mapping with the structure of addition (e.g., 4 ants 3 beetles 7 insects), semantically unrelated sets are misaligned with addition. This misalignment arises because one would need to traverse many links in the semantic network to find the superset that corresponds to their sum (e.g., 4 hens 3 radios 7 things). Such intermediate links (e.g., hens are farm birds, which are animate creatures, which are things) introduce relational mis- matches with the operation of addition, in which the addends are directly related to their sum.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="78" page="3" column="1">The trial stimuli were random combinations of 80 word triplets and 48 digit triplets. Each trial consisted of a priming word pair (e.g., tulips– daisies) with its word target (e.g., tulips) and a pair of cue digits (e.g., 2 3) with its digit target (e.g., 5). Below, we first describe the word and the digit triplets and then explain how the word and the digit triplets were combined. Word triplets. All word stimuli were plural nouns that could serve as referents of object sets (e.g., birds, coats, thieves, stories). We first selected a set of candidate singular nouns from word- norms databases ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="70" class="deo:Reference">Battig &amp; Montague, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="71" class="deo:Reference">Coltheart, 1981</xref>). The candidate words were in the upper 10% of word frequency, familiarity, and concreteness. Their syllable count was restricted to be between one and five. From this candidate word set, we constructed 80 word triplets in which the nouns were transformed from singulars to plurals (e.g., from stain to stains ). Half of the<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> triplets consisted of categorically related nouns, which we refer to as aligned-categorical, or AC, triplets (e.g., oaks, elms, and maples). 3 The other half consisted of unrelated nouns, which we refer to as misaligned-unrelated, or MU, triplets (e.g., marbles, guards, and ponds). The two sets of AC and MU triplets were matched for word frequency, familiarity, concreteness, and syllable count. The AC and MU word triplets appear, respectively, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="73" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" id="74" class="deo:Reference">Table 2</xref>. In each word triplet, two words were designated to serve as the priming word pair and the third as the target. In order to balance the number of “yes” and “no” responses, half of the target words matched one of the priming words (correct response is “yes”) and the other half did not (correct response is “no”). Specifically, of the 40 AC triplets, 20 had a matching target (e.g., horses, donkeys, and horses) and 20 a nonmatching AC target (e.g., ants, beetles, and spiders). Similarly, of the 40 MU triplets, 20 had a matching target (e.g., gowns, bridges, and bridges) and 20 a nonmatching MU target (e.g., napkins, cats, and authors). Half of the matching targets matched the left, and the other half matched the right words of the priming pairs. Relatedness ratings for all the priming word pairs used in Experiment 1 were obtained from a subset of participants (n 33) after they had completed all the experimental trials of the word- digit matching task. These participants rated the extent to which the priming word pairs were related to each other on a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating that the words were completely unrelated and 7 indicating that the words were highly related. Each participant provided ratings to 60 word pairs that were selected at random from the 80 priming pairs used in the experiment. AC pairs (M 5.97, SD 0.73) received significantly higher relatedness ratings than the MU pairs (M 1.42, SD 0.42), t(32) 37.60, p .001. Digit triplets. Forty-eight digit triplets were adapted from the “standard” stimuli cues used by Lefevre and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37" id="75" class="deo:Reference">Kulak (1994)</xref>. Each digit triplet consisted of a pair of cue digits and a digit target. The cue digits (m n) were of the form m 1, n 1, and m n (e.g., 3 2). Half of the digit targets matched one of the cue digits and half did not. Half of the matching targets matched the left and half matched the right cue digit. The complete set of digit stimuli used in Experiment 1 appears in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" id="76" class="deo:Reference">Table 3</xref>. Half of the triplets had matching targets (correct response “yes”), and the other half had targets that did not match either one of the cue digits (correct response “no”). Only triplets with nonmatching digit targets are relevant for assessing the sum effect (24 triplets total). The cue digits of these triplets appear in the leftmost column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" id="77" class="deo:Reference">Table 3</xref>. The target digits ranged from 5 to 9 and, depending on the cue digits, served as either sum or neutral targets. Twelve triplets consisted of the cue digits and their sum target</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="79" confidence="possible" page="3" column="2">3 The decision that certain priming pairs are categorically related was based solely on the authors’ judgment. After the studies were completed, we realized that some of the AC word pairs had a set–subset relation (e.g., a kayak is a kind of a canoe). We therefore asked participants from a similar population to rate the degree to which the AC word pairs were categorically related. As we describe in the Method section of Experiment 2, these ratings were consistent with our original classification. More important, the set–subset pairs received categorical ratings similar to those of the purely categorical pairs.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="101" page="4" column="2">In order to ensure that people attend to both the priming words and the cue digits, on each experimental trial, participants had to make two matching decisions (“Did you see X? yes/no”): one to a word target (e.g., X ants; X spiders) and one to a digit target (e.g., X 3; X 9). To discourage dual-tasking strategies, on half of the trials, the digit target appeared first and was followed by the word target, and on the other half, the word target appeared first. Although participants responded to both word and digit targets, only trials in which the digit targets appeared first (i.e., immedi- ately after the cue digits) preserved the structure of the original number-matching task ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="95" class="deo:Reference">LeFevre et al., 1988</xref>). These trials provide the cleanest test of whether semantically aligned or misaligned word pairs would prime the sum effect. Hence, we only report the results pertaining to the latencies and error rates of the relevant digit targets in the digit-first condition, comparing the trials in which these digits were primed by the semantically aligned and the semantically misaligned word pairs. Participants were tested in small groups of 4 –13. They received verbal and written instructions explaining that they would see pairs of words and digits and, subsequently, see word and digit probes. Their task was to respond “yes” if the probe was one of the items that were just presented and “no” if it was not. Participants were instructed to place the index finger of their preferred hand on the 2 key on the numerical keypad of the keyboard. They had to indicate their “yes” and “no” responses by pressing the 1 and 3 (or<marker type="page" number="5"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> 3 and 1) keys, respectively, and then return their index finger to the centered 2 key. They were instructed to respond as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Participants were also told that they would be taking a memory recognition test at the end of the word-digit matching task to test their memory for the words seen during the experiment. This instruction was intended to encourage semantic processing of the words (Schreuder, Giovanni, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46" id="99" class="deo:Reference">Glazenborg, 1984</xref>), but we did not administer the memory test. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="100" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref> depicts the sequence of events on each experimental trial. Each trial began with an asterisk prompt in the middle of the screen. The prompt remained on the screen until the participant pressed the 2 key on the numeric keypad of the keyboard. At this keypress, a randomly selected pair of priming words appeared on the screen. The words were presented in line-drawn boxes, one box on the left and the other on the right side of the screen’s center. After 480 ms of this words display, a pair of randomly selected cue digits appeared in the boxes above the words, and a plus sign appeared between the two boxes. The priming words and the cue digits remained on the screen for an additional 135 ms, at which point the stimuli were erased and masked for 16.7 ms. The com- puter then randomly selected either a digit or a word target and displayed it at the center of the screen. This target remained on the screen until the participant responded, or for a maximum of 2 s. Participants pressed the designated yes or no keys to indicate whether the target digit or word was presented in that trial. They received written feedback, either “RIGHT” in green letters or “WRONG” in red letters, which remained on the screen for 500 ms. Lack of response within 2 s also received the feedback “WRONG.” After the feedback to the first target disappeared, the second target was presented at the center of the screen. In the digit-first condition, the second target was a word; in the word-first condition, the second target was a digit. Participants responded to the second target in the same manner they responded to the first. Consecutive trials were separated by a forced 2-s delay. Each participant received a unique randomized sequence of 160 trials that had a balanced 4 (word triplet) 4 (digit triplet) 2</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="103" page="5" column="2">(target order) factorial design, with five trials in each experimental cell. The four word-triplet conditions were AC prime/matching target, AC prime/nonmatching target, MU prime/matching target, and MU prime/nonmatching target. The four digit-triplet conditions were sum, neutral, cue control, and target control. The two target-order conditions were digit first and word first. The word triplets were selected at random without replacement until all 80 triplets were exhausted and then sampled again for a total of 160 trials. The digit triplets were selected at random without replacement until all 48 triplets were exhausted, and this sampling was repeated for a total of 160 trials. The constraints on the random draw of the word and digit combinations were such that there were no more than two consecutive identical trial types and no more than four identical consecutive correct responses (e.g., “no”). Participants received 20 practice trials that were similar to the experimental trials. Although we wanted participants to get famil- iar with the matching task, we did not want them to think about the relation between the words and the digits. Accordingly, all the word triplets in the practice trials were unrelated (e.g., notes, cords, and tubes). These word triplets were not used in the sub- sequent experimental trials. The practice trials were followed by a brief clarification break during which the experimenter verified that the participants understood the task. The participants then proceeded to perform the 160 experimental trials. They took ap- proximately 12 min to complete this task.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="117" page="5" column="2">Data from 1 participant who failed to respond correctly on any trials in multiple conditions were excluded. All analyses were performed on data from the remaining 153 participants. The mean latencies and standard errors for sum and neutral digit targets in the AC and the MU conditions appear in the upper part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4" id="107" class="deo:Reference">Table 4</xref>. Latencies were computed on correct responses to sum and neutral targets, excluding responses of trials in which participants responded incorrectly to the subsequently presented word targets (thus ensuring that the digit latencies pertained only to trials in which we had evidence that the participants processed the relevant priming words). The mean number of responses per cell that met these correctness criteria was 7.2 (SD 1.8). Geometric means were computed because they are less susceptible to outliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="108" class="deo:Reference">Alf &amp; Grossberg, 1979</xref>; cf. Lu, Morrison, Hummel, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38" id="109" class="deo:Reference">Holyoak, 2006</xref>); arithmetic means yield the same rank order of conditions. As in previous studies documenting obligatory activation of addition facts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="110" class="deo:Reference">LeFevre et al., 1988</xref>), participants took signif-<marker type="page" number="6"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> icantly longer to reject the sum (909 ms) than the neutral digit targets (878 ms), F(1, 152) 20.93, MSE 7,173, p .001. More important, there was a highly significant Priming Words Digit Target interaction that was consistent with our semantic alignment hypothesis, F(1, 152) 23.176, MSE 6,101, p .001. Planned comparisons revealed that in the AC condition, participants took 62 ms longer to reject sum over neutral targets, t(152) 5.79, p .001. By contrast, in the MU condition, there was no difference in the time it took participants to reject sum versus neutral targets (M 1 ms, t 1). Thus, as predicted by the semantic alignment hypothesis, the sum effect occurred in the AC but did not occur in the MU condition. No significant overall difference was found between MU (896 ms) and AC priming conditions (892 ms), F(1, 152) 0.32, MSE 6,327, p .575. Yet, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4" id="116" class="deo:Reference">Table 4</xref>, the latencies of the sum and the neutral targets in the MU condition (896 ms and 895 ms, respectively) fell between the values of the sum and the neutral latencies in the AC condition (923 ms and 861 ms, respectively). Planned comparisons revealed that sum latencies were significantly longer in the AC than in the MU condition (27 ms), t(152) 2.76, p .007, whereas neutral latencies were significantly shorter in the AC condition than in the MU condition (34 ms), t(152) 4.13, p .001. This pattern of results seems to suggest that, relative to the MU condition, the sum effect observed in the AC condition was due to both an enhanced activation of sum targets and a suppressed activation of neutral (non-sum) targets. 4</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="124" page="6" column="2">The latency and the error results of Experiment 1 showed that, as we predicted, a priming context of semantically aligned and misaligned object relations modulates automatic activation of addition facts. Categorically related word primes, which are aligned with addition, led to a significant sum effect. At the same time, semantically unrelated word primes, which are misaligned with addition, did not elicit the sum effect. As we have explained earlier, the categorical primes provide an appropriate and highly practiced relational context for performing the addition operation. The highly significant sum effect obtained in the AC condition suggests that this context supported automatic activation of addition facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="123" class="deo:Reference">LeFevre et al., 1988</xref>). The lack of sum effects in the MU condition is consistent with our entering conjecture that unrelated primes provide a semantic context that is incongruent with performing the addition operation and, therefore, block automatic activation of addition facts. 6 Despite the consistency of the present results with our entering semantic alignment hypothesis, it is possible that the difference in the relative impact of AC and MU primes on the activation of addition facts was mediated by factors other than the alignment of semantic and arithmetic relations. In particular, because the words in the AC primes were highly related to each other, whereas the words in the MU primes were not, it is possible that differences in the activation of addition facts in the two priming conditions were somehow modulated by the degree of relatedness between the</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="131" confidence="possible" page="6" column="2">4 In research on semantic priming, such a pattern of response latencies to targets (sum) and their alternatives (here neutral) is explained in terms of “center-surround inhibition,” whereby it is assumed that suppression of the alternatives assists in retrieval of the relevant targets (e.g., Dagenbach, Carr, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="125" class="deo:Reference">Barnhardt, 1990</xref>; Herd, Banich, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="126" class="deo:Reference">O’Reilly, 2006</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32" id="127" class="deo:Reference">Kahan, 2000</xref>, for a different interpretation of such latency patterns). Note, however, that it is impossible to determine whether the present pattern of results reflects center-surround inhibition. This is because, in the present para- digm, there is no baseline level of activation to which one could compare the sum and neutral latencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="128" class="deo:Reference">Jonides &amp; Mack, 1984</xref>). 5 The error rates in our word– digit coordination experiments were quite high (25%–30%, see Tables 4 and 6). A significant proportion of these errors (about 30%) were responses to word targets that followed the digit targets. Even so, these error rates were much higher than those obtained in prior digits-only studies (e.g., 3%–5% for similar digits in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37" id="129" class="deo:Reference">LeFevre &amp; Kulak, 1994</xref>). These high error rates attest to the relative difficulty of the coordination task, which required attention to both digits and words. 6 We use the terms support and block quite loosely, as the present study cannot illuminate the mechanism by which the semantic context modulates the spread of activation in the arithmetic network. The reader may refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40" id="130" class="deo:Reference">Mathis (2002)</xref> for a thorough discussion of three possible accounts (block- ing, slowing, and inhibition) of similar context effects that were obtained in a task involving object identification.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="137" page="7" column="1">Experiment 2 replicated the design of Experiment 1, except that we replaced the MU primes used in Experiment 1 (e.g., clowns– ovens) with misaligned functionally (MF) related primes (e.g., ships–sailors). Unlike the MU primes, the words in the MF primes were highly related; however, the MF sets were also misaligned with addition. In fact, they were aligned with the alternative arithmetic operation of division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="136" class="deo:Reference">Bassok et al., 1998</xref>). By contrast- ing the magnitude of the sum effect for AC and MF primes, we eliminated the confounding in Experiment 2 between the effects of relatedness per se and the effects of semantic alignment. If the high relatedness of the AC primes was responsible for the activation of addition facts in Experiment 1, then we should observe similarly high sum effects in both the AC and the MF priming conditions of Experiment 2. But if, as we believe, the results of Experiment 1 were modulated by semantic alignment, then we should observe a more pronounced sum effect in the AC than in the MF priming condition of Experiment 2.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="145" page="7" column="1">Digit triplets and AC word triplets were identical to those used in Experiment 1 (see again Tables 3 and 1, respectively). MU word triplets were replaced with MF triplets, which we constructed using the databases and the selection criteria described in Experiment 1. The priming word pairs in the MF triplets were plural nouns referring to objects known to be related by many-to-one semantic relations, such as contain (e.g., birds– cages) or consume (e.g., squirrels–nuts). Half of the MF triplets had matching targets (e.g., harps, strings, and harps), and the other half had mismatch- ing but thematically related targets (e.g., babies, cribs, and dia- pers). The MF word triplets used in Experiment 2 appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5" id="141" class="deo:Reference">Table 5</xref>. The word and the digit triplets were combined to form 160 experimental trials by the same randomized process used in Experiment 1. As in Experiment 1, relatedness ratings for all the priming word pairs used in Experiment 2 were obtained from a subset of participants (n 87) after they had completed all the experimental trials of the matching task. When analyzing these relatedness ratings, we discovered that 2 of the 40 primes that participants saw in the MF condition were, in fact, AC primes. We excluded these 2 triplets from all data analyses. Relatedness ratings of the 38 MF primes (M 5.39, SD 0.95) were significantly higher than those of the 40 AC primes (M 5.20, SD 1.02), t(86) 2.53, p .013.<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> In order to validate our intuitions about the nature of the relations between the priming words, we also asked a separate group of 108 participants to rate, on a scale of 1–7, the degree to which the priming words were categorically related (n 55), or the degree to which they were functionally related (n 53). Each participant rated half of the categorically related and half of the functionally related word pairs used in the experiment. Their ratings were consistent with our classification, and there was no overlap in the rating distributions of the categorical and the functional word pairs. Specifically, the categorical ratings of the AC pairs (M 6.25, SD 1.13) were significantly higher than those of the MF pairs (M 2.92, SD 1.27), t(54) 13.83, p .001. Similarly, the functional ratings of the MF pairs (M 6.07, SD 0.72) were significantly higher than those of the AC pairs (M 1.79, SD 0.85), t(52) 26.82, p .001. The apparatus and the procedure used in Experiment 2 were the same as in Experiment 1.</region>

The pattern of errors was similar to that in the latency data, ruling out speed– accuracy trade-offs as an explanation of the pattern of latency differences across the priming conditions. The interaction between the priming words and activation of addition facts in Experiment 2 occurred even though, unlike in Experiment 1, the word pairs comprising the misaligned primes were highly related; in fact, they received significantly higher relatedness ratings than did the word pairs comprising the AC primes. Moreover, a separate group of participants from a similar population made a clear distinction between categorical and the- matic relations. Hence, in addition to replicating the findings of Experiment 1, the results of Experiment 2 showed that obligatory activation of addition facts is modulated by the congruence of the priming semantic relation with addition and not just by the degree of relatedness between the priming words.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="181" page="8" column="2">The experiments reported in the present article show that semantic relations in word primes provide a context that modulates automatic activation of addition facts. Categorically related word primes, which provide a relational context that is appropriate for addition, led to obligatory (involuntary) activation of addition facts, replicating the pattern of latencies (sum effect) found in studies of cognitive arithmetic ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="163" class="deo:Reference">LeFevre et al., 1988</xref>). Unrelated word primes (Experiment 1) and functionally related word primes (Experiment 2), which provide a relational context that is inappropriate for addition, blocked such automatic activation of addition facts. The fluent coordination between semantic and arithmetic relations found in the present study is consistent with people’s extensive experience with applications of addition to real-life problems. Obviously, people are capable of adding unrelated or functionally related objects—and in some contexts, people are even asked to do so (e.g., adding flowers, vases, and milk cartons when choosing the express checkout in a supermarket). Yet, both in and out of school, people mainly add highly similar or categorically related objects. The present results indicate that such semantic “applicability con- ditions” modulate people’s spontaneous access to addition facts, thereby highlighting the importance of arithmetic applications to theoretical accounts of mental arithmetic. In particular, the fluency with which people integrate categorical object relations with their knowledge of addition facts should be incorporated into models of arithmetic competence that, to date, separate people’s arithmetic knowledge from the rest of their conceptual knowledge (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="164" class="deo:Reference">Campbell &amp; Epp, 2005</xref>). The finding that an incongruent semantic context blocks obligatory activation of addition facts may be viewed as quite surpris- ing, as it “flies in the face of any automaticity account in which the specified processes cannot be prevented from being set in motion” (Besner, Stolz, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="165" class="deo:Reference">Boutilier, 1997</xref>, p. 221). Yet, a growing body of evidence shows similar modulation effects, be it in word recognition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="166" class="deo:Reference">Besner &amp; Stolz, 1999</xref>), object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40" id="167" class="deo:Reference">Mathis, 2002</xref>), or even in cognitive arithmetic (Rusconi, Galfano, Speriani, &amp; Umilt `, 2004). Our results seem to support the conclusions of Besner and colleagues, who, in discussing automatic access to<marker type="page" number="9"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> word meanings, have suggested that processes that are considered as obligatory or “ballistic” should, instead, be treated as a “default” that can be overridden by context. In cognitive arithmetic, this overriding context could be an incongruent spatial configuration, as shown by Ruscani et al. (2004), or, as in the present study, semantically incongruent applicability conditions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="171" class="deo:Reference">Bassok et al. (1998)</xref>, the congruity between arithmetic operations and their application context is determined by semantic alignment. For the operation of addition, this entails analogical mapping between the semantic roles of categorically related objects with respect to their joint superset, and the mathematical roles of the addends with respect to their sum. Bassok and her colleagues found that people are guided by such alignments when they solve or construct mathematical word problems (Bassok, 2001). The results of the present experiments extend this prior work by showing that, for the operation of addition, aligned semantic relations prime access to analogous arithmetic relations, whereas misaligned semantic relations block such access. The priming results reported here are consistent with prior work that has established the viability of analogical priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48" id="172" class="deo:Reference">Spellman et al., 2001</xref>). Using lexical decision and word-naming tasks, Spellman et al. (2001) found that word pairs (e.g., bear–cave) were processed faster when they were primed by word pairs that shared the same semantic relation (e.g., bird–nest) than when they were primed by word pairs that had a different semantic relation (e.g., window–glass). Such relational facilitation, however, was not completely automatic—it occurred only when the participants were explicitly directed to attend to and use the shared semantic relations in the priming and the target word pairs. In the experiments reported here, unlike the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48" id="173" class="deo:Reference">Spellman et al. (2001)</xref>, the alignment of the categorical semantic relation (e.g., tulips and daisies are flowers) with addition (e.g., 2 3 5) appears to be highly automatic. 7 One reason for this difference could be that Spellman et al. assessed analogical priming using a different methodology. In particular, our experimental task juxta- posed word and digit pairs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="174" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref>) in a manner that was likely to evoke the context of arithmetic applications. It is therefore possible that this juxtaposition alleviated the need for explicit instructions that focus people’s attention on relational similarities. Of course, it is also possible that access to semantically aligned arithmetic operations is, in fact, more automatic than is access to semantic analogies. This possibility would be consistent with people’s extensive experience in using the same arithmetic operation (e.g., addition) to solve problems involving a variety of semantically aligned object sets (e.g., blue and red marbles; cars and trucks, cupcakes and brownies). Such an experience should lead to abstraction of operation-relevant relational commonalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29" id="175" class="deo:Reference">Hummel &amp; Holyoak, 2003</xref>) and, in turn, increase the probability of spontaneous analogical access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="176" class="deo:Reference">Forbus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="177" class="deo:Reference">Hummel &amp; Holyoak, 1997</xref>). Although the present findings are consistent with prior work on relational priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48" id="178" class="deo:Reference">Spellman et al., 2001</xref>) and on semantic alignments in word problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="179" class="deo:Reference">Bassok et al., 1998</xref>), they are restricted to the correspondence between categorical relations and the operation of addition. It remains to be established whether the present pattern of priming results can be extended to other combinations of semantic and arithmetic relations. In particular, to preclude the possibility that these findings were mediated by the unique properties of categorical relations, one would want to determine<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> whether functionally related sets, but not categorically related sets, prime division facts. The generality of our findings and the validity of our relational-priming interpretation have to await future research. In conclusion, the present studies show that the semantic conditions for applying the arithmetic operation of addition modulate automatic access to digit sums. These findings have direct bearing on researchers’ understanding of mental arithmetic. In particular, to the extent that addition facts are represented in a specialized arithmetic memory network, the present findings show that this network is seamlessly coordinated with people’s semantic knowledge. Because the semantic conditions for applying arithmetic operations are relational in nature, the present findings probably reflect automatic analogical alignment of semantic and arithmetic relations. Further research is needed to validate this processing conjecture and determine the generality of our findings.</region>
