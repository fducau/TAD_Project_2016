      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="22" confidence="possible">Goal research has documented the significant role of goals in people’s choice, evaluation, and  emotion (Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998; Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985; Fishbach &amp; Ferguson, 2007; Gollwitzer, 1990;  Higgins, 1997; Kruglanski, 1996; Locke &amp; Latham, 1990; Mischel, Cantor, &amp; Feldman, 1996). In recent  years, the main emphasis of goal research has been on the nonconscious processes of goal pursuit  (Aarts &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2000; Chartrand &amp; Bargh, 1996; Ferguson &amp; Bargh, 2004; Moskowitz, 2002). This  research has yielded important insights into the factors that activate a goal, how the goal influences  choice of goal‐related actions, the positive evaluation of goal‐facilitating actions and the devaluation of  goal‐inhibiting actions, and how success or failure at pursuing a goal influences a person’s emotional  states.  In most of this prior goal research, the basic unit of study was the activation of a single goal and  the initiation of a single goal‐congruent action in response to the goal; that is, the focus was on the  single goal ‐ single action unit (Aarts, Gollwitzer, &amp; Hassin, 2004; Bargh, Gollwitzer, Lee‐Chai, Barndollar,  &amp; Troetschel, 2001; Shah &amp; Kruglanski, 2003). Whereas a single goal ‐ single action unit is the basic unit  of observation for motivation research, it is also true that people rarely hold only one goal at a time.  People often hold several accessible goals and consider the simultaneous pursuit of multiple and  frequently inconsistent ones (Cantor &amp; Langston, 1989; Emmons &amp; King, 1988; Higgins, 1997; Kruglanski  et al., 2002; Markus &amp; Ruvolo, 1989). In addition, people often select several goal‐directed actions  simultaneously and with respect to one another. Prior and planned future actions can then influence a  person’s choice of immediate goal actions and their subjective value (Read, Loewenstein, &amp; Rabin, 1999;  Simonson, 1990). For example, walking into a restaurant can simultaneously evoke multiple goals when  a person is concerned about selecting food items that are tasty, healthful, and inexpensive. In addition,  people usually make successive choices from the menu (e.g., choice of an appetizer, an entrée, and a </region>
      <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="23">dessert), which in turn can potentially create a balance among the simultaneously activated goals, or  people can emphasize one goal over the others. </outsider>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="24">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  3</region>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="25" confidence="possible">When people hold several goals and have the opportunity to select several actions that unfold  over time, there are two possible patterns of choice they can follow. First, their choice sequence can  balance between the underlying goals. Second, their choice sequence can highlight the most important  goal. In this chapter, I identify the conditions under which people find balance among several goals  versus highlight a single goal across several actions. Thus, my basic unit of observation involves at least  two goals and two opportunities to act on these goals, which can balance or reinforce each other. In  such situations, I ask what increases the motivation to work on a focal goal—an initial failure to act on  the goal, which motivates actions when people balance, or an initial goal pursuit, which motivates  congruent action when people highlight.  To address these questions, my colleges and I have conducted a program of research on “the  dynamics of self‐regulation” (Fishbach &amp; Dhar, 2005; Fishbach, Dhar, &amp; Zhang, 2006; Fishbach &amp; Zhang,  2008; Koo &amp; Fishbach, 2008; Zhang, Fishbach, &amp; Dhar, 2007; see also Fitzsimons, et al., this volume). This  research addresses the simultaneous pursuit of multiple goals through a sequence of actions that  evolves over time and can either balance between these multiple underlying goals or highlight the single  most important one. Our basic premise is that people represent goal actions in terms of either making  progress or expressing commitment. As a result of these two representations of goal actions, people  either balance between goals on which they experience progress or highlight goals to which they feel  committed.  In what follows, I discuss this theoretical framework in greater detail. I begin by addressing the  self‐regulatory process in each of the two dynamics: progress‐based balancing versus commitment‐ based highlighting. Then, I address variables that determine the specific framing of goals and the  corresponding dynamics that people follow. </region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="27" confidence="possible">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  I proposed that people represent goal actions in terms of either progress toward a desirable end  state or commitment to this end state. What, then, characterizes the process of self‐regulation under  each of these representations?  First, in a progress representation of goals, a person feels motivated to choose actions that  reduce the discrepancy between the existing undesirable state and a desirable end state. Cybernetic  models of self‐regulation describe a process of self‐regulation that assumes a progress representation of  goals and is oriented toward reducing a discrepancy (Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998, this volume; Locke &amp;  Latham, 1990; Miller, Galanter, &amp; Pribram, 1960; Powers, 1973). According to these models, people  consider the progress they have made toward the end state in the course of goal pursuit, and their  perceived progress elicits a sense of partial goal attainment, thus signaling that less effort is needed to  accomplish the goal. For example, a student studying a textbook can monitor the progress toward and  the remaining effort necessary to finish the book. In turn, any progress in reading will signal that the  goal has been partially attained. Notably, a similar focus on progress can also characterize ongoing goals  with no clear end state⎯for example, when a student perceives progress toward the goal of mastering  a body of knowledge (e.g., learning to speak Hebrew). When there is no clear end state, the perception  of progress is not defined by a reduction of discrepancy.  Second, people can represent goal actions in terms of expressing commitment to the desirable  end state. In a commitment representation of goals, a person perceives the pursuit of congruent actions  as a signal that goal commitment is high. Commitment is defined as a subjective sense that the goal is  valuable and that the expectancy of success is high (Atkinson, 1964; Atkinson &amp; Raynor, 1978; Bem,  1972; Cialdini, Trost, &amp; Newsom, 1995; Feather, 1990). This representation of goals is less concerned </region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="31" confidence="possible">example, the student studying a textbook may experience greater commitment to study the book or, in  general, master the particular body of knowledge, after partially completing the book. In this situation,  the student feels that the goal is more valuable and attainable following initial successful pursuit. For  example, she feels that learning to speak Hebrew is an important part of her identity. The  representation of goals in terms of making progress versus expressing commitment then determines the  pattern of self‐regulation a person follows when he or she simultaneously holds multiple goals.  Progressed‐Based Balancing  In a progress representation, an initial goal‐congruent action is experienced as partial  attainment of the end state. As a result, a person feels justified in relaxing his or her efforts toward this  particular end state and, instead, attends to other, relatively neglected goals. This pattern of self‐ regulation reflects balancing, a dynamic in which the pursuit of one goal motivates a person to relax his  or her efforts at the next opportunity whereas failure to pursue a goal motivates a person to increase his  or her efforts at the next opportunity.  As an example of balancing, consider research on variety seeking, which has documented  people’s tendency to switch between consumption goals (McAlister &amp; Pessemier, 1982; Ratner, Kahn, &amp;  Kahneman, 1999), or moral licensing research (Monin &amp; Miller, 2001), which has documented people’s  tendency to switch between expressing egalitarian values and relying on intuitive (stereotypical)  judgments. There are further social organizations that advocate balancing as a prevailing self‐regulatory  principle. For example, Weight Watchers recommends a “point system” in which dieters can trade off  eating and exercising (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" href="http://www.weightwatchers.com/plan/eat/plans.aspx)," id="30">http://www.weightwatchers.com/plan/eat/plans.aspx),</ext-link> and Catholicism, as a  religious philosophy, advocates balancing between (few) sins and (much) good works.  Commitment‐Based Highlighting </region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="33">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  6</region>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="34" confidence="possible">attainment is high. Such interpretation of commitment increases a person’s motivation to take similar,  complementary actions and to inhibit any competing goals (Shah, Friedman, &amp; Kruglanski, 2003) to  ensure the pursuit of the goal to which he or she is highly committed. The subsequent self‐regulatory  process is highlighting, a dynamic of self‐regulation in which the pursuit of one action motivates a  person to pursue other, congruent actions that facilitate the same goal because the person is prioritizing  this particular goal over others.  Research on the goal gradient hypothesis, or the “goal‐looms‐larger” effect, demonstrates a  pattern of highlighting, such that people allocate more efforts to a goal after experiencing some initial  accomplishment (Forster, Higgins, &amp; Idson, 1998; Forster &amp; Liberman, this volume; Hull, 1934; Kivetz,  Urminsky, &amp; Zheng, 2006; Losco &amp; Epstein, 1977). In addition, there are social organizations that  advocate highlighting. For example, Alcoholics Anonymous (www.alcoholics‐anonymous.org) is an  organization that advocates complete sobriety rather than establishing drinking habits that balance the  amount of alcohol consumed. Similarly, Calvinism, as a religious philosophy, preaches a life of good  works exclusively rather than balancing sins with the pursuit of good works.  Figure 1 summarizes our model. The representation of goals in terms of progress toward a  desirable end state increases the tendency to move away from that goal after initial pursuit and to  attend to competing motives through a dynamic of balancing. The representation of goals in terms of  commitment to a desirable end state increases the tendency to highlight the goal by selecting congruent  actions that pursue the same goal after the initial pursuit. As a result, the same action can have opposite  consequences. For example, applying sunscreen decreases the likelihood of wearing a sunhat when it  signals that progress has been made toward the overall goal of preventing sun damage, but the same  action can increase the likelihood of wearing a sunhat when it signals greater commitment to preventing </region>
      <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="35">sun damage.  </outsider>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="36">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  7</region>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="37" confidence="possible">In addition, after failing to pursue an initial goal action, inferences of low progress increase  people’s interest in similar, complementary actions, whereas inferences of low commitment decrease  people’s interest in such actions. For example, failing to apply sunscreen increases the likelihood of  wearing a sunhat when it signals low progress toward the health goal, but it decreases the likelihood of  wearing a sunhat when it signals low commitment to that goal. Notably, then, a progress frame results  in substitution between actions through balancing, whereas a commitment frame results in consistency  between actions through highlighting.  In summary, two factors increase people’s motivation to work on a goal: the perception of a lack  of goal progress, which is based on lack of goal actions, and the perception of goal commitment, which  is based on completed goal actions. In addition, two factors undermine people’s motivation to work on a  goal: the perception of low commitment, which is based on lack of goal actions, and the perception of  sufficient progress, which is based on completed goal actions.  Empirical Support  Fishbach and Dhar (2005) conducted a series of studies to test whether the same action can  both increase and decrease the motivation to choose another goal‐congruent action, depending on  whether a person infers goal commitment or goal progress. In one study, they manipulated the  representation of goal actions by asking participants questions that focused their attention on the  commitment to or progress toward pursuit of their goals. Participants then indicated their motivation to  balance between the focal goal and another, competing goal, or highlight the focal goal across  successive actions. For example, with regard to academic goals, student participants indicated whether  they felt   committed to academic tasks whenever they studied versus whether they believed that they  made progress on their academic tasks whenever they studied. Participants who viewed their sense of </region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="41" confidence="possible">viewed their sense of progress as a result of their actions indicated that they would be interested in  socializing at night if they studied during the day. These effects were replicated across several goal  domains, such as saving money and preventing sun damage (Fishbach &amp; Dhar, 2005, Study 3), suggesting  that the focus on commitment versus progress promoted a subsequent choice of actions that  highlighted the focal goal versus balanced between that goal and alternative ones.  Other studies documented the effect of planned, future goal actions on the choice of present  actions as a function of the dynamic of self‐regulation. Specifically, Zhang et al. (2007) hypothesized that  planned actions should have a similar effect as completed actions; that is, they can either signal greater  commitment or competence (Atkinson, 1964; Bandura, 1997; Taylor &amp; Brown, 1988; Weiner, 1979),  which promotes similar goal pursuits in the present, or they can signal progress and substitute for  present actions (Oettingen &amp; Mayer, 2002). Moreover, because the effect of planned actions is in direct  proportion to the amount of goal pursuit considered, when people are overly optimistic and believe that  they will achieve more in the future than in the past (Buehler, Griffin, &amp; Ross, 1994; Weinstein, 1989;  Zauberman &amp; Lynch, 2005), future plans should have greater impact on immediate goal pursuits than  retrospection on actual past actions.  In a study that supports these predictions, Zhang et al. (2007, Study 1) assessed gym users’  interest in a healthful drink (i.e., a bottle of water) over an unhealthful drink (i.e., a can of sugared soda),  after considering past versus future workouts. The researchers find that, in general, gym users are  optimistic and believe that they will work out more in the future than they did during a comparable  period in the past. As a result, gym users who considered their commitment to exercise based on future  plans expressed more interest in a healthful drink than those who considered their commitment based  on exercising habits in the past. Conversely, gym users who considered their progress based on future </region>
      <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="43"> plans expressed less interest in a healthful drink than those who focused on their progress based on  exercising in the past (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fexercising in the past (see Figure 2" id="42" class="deo:Reference">Figure 2</xref>). </outsider>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="45" confidence="possible">What Determines the Dynamics of Self‐Regulation?  The previous section identified two dynamics of self‐regulation: commitment‐based balancing  and progress‐based highlighting. In these dynamics, people make present choices to pursue a goal on  the basis of either past or future goal pursuits. In this section, I ask what makes people represent goals  in terms of commitment or progress in the first place? I propose that the representation of goals and the  resultant dynamic of self‐regulation depend on (a) the information the person seeks – whether it  concerns commitment or ensuring that sufficient progress is being made and (b) the information that is  in the presentation of action alternatives—whether it suggests that the alternatives substitute for or  complement each other.  The Information the Perceiver Seeks  Research on the dynamics of self‐regulation has often used framing questions to direct people’s  attention to the progress versus commitment from their goal actions. For example, in prior studies, to  induce a progress frame of the health goal, my colleagues and I asked gym users to indicate whether  they were getting healthier, and to induce a commitment frame of that goal, we asked them to indicate  whether exercising was important to them (Fishbach &amp; Dhar, 2005; Zhang et al., 2007). But how do  these framing questions work? We assume that people ask themselves these questions; that is “Am I  making progress?” or “Is it important to me?” To provide an answer, they need to focus on a certain  aspect of their goal pursuits—namely, either progress or commitment.   However, there are other variables that determine whether people will ask about commitment  or progress and the resultant dynamic of self‐regulation. These include the type of the goal (i.e.,  whether it is typically represented in terms of commitment or progress) and the person’s experience  pursuing it.  </region>
      <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="46">Specifically, people ask about goal commitment when their commitment is somewhat  ambiguous⎯that is, uncertain or relatively low. When people feel unsure about their level of goal </outsider>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="47" confidence="possible">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  10 commitment, their primary concern is to evaluate whether the goal is important to them and worth  pursuing further, and they infer greater commitment on the basis of accomplished goal actions. For  example, whether people perceive goal commitment would influence their decision to donate money to  a novel (vs. familiar) charity or to study for a moderately (vs. highly) important course. When  commitment is under consideration, in such situations, accomplished actions increase the motivation to  work on a goal through a dynamic of highlighting. For example, emphasizing the amount of money that  has been donated to date or the amount of completed coursework would be more motivating than  emphasizing the amount of money that is still missing or the amount of remaining coursework.  In contrast, people ask about goal progress when they are relatively certain about their  commitment to a goal. When a goal is unambiguously important and expectancy of attainment is  known, a person’s motivation is based on inferences of need for progress (see Brunstein &amp; Gollwitzer,  1996; Wicklund &amp; Gollwitzer, 1982). As such, emphasizing unaccomplished goal actions or actions that  pursue a competing goal would be more motivating through a dynamic of balancing. For example, a  need for progress should be motivating when people are deciding whether to donate money to a  familiar and valuable charity or when they are studying for a highly (vs. moderately) important course. In  these situations, the focus on the amount of money that is needed to reach a campaign goal and the  remaining work to complete a course will be more motivating than information about accomplishments.  Koo and Fishbach (2008) tested for these ideas in a series of studies that manipulated the level  of initial commitment and the focus on what had already been accomplished (to date) versus what  remained to be accomplished (to go). Their studies used goals with a clear end state, and thus any  accomplishment (e.g., 50% to date) could be framed as a required accomplishment (e.g., 50% to go)  without altering the objective information. The question was which emphasis is more motivating. Koo </region>
      <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="48">and Fishbach predicted that the relative impact of to‐date versus to‐go information would depend on a  person’s commitment certainty. That is, a 50% to‐date frame signals commitment and will increase </outsider>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="49" confidence="possible">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  11 motivation when people are not certain about their commitment to their goal and ponder the value of  the goal and expectancy of success. In contrast, a 50% to‐go frame signals a need for progress and will  be more motivating when people ask whether more progress is needed to attain their goal.  In an experiment that tested these predictions (Koo &amp; Fishbach, 2008, Study 1), undergraduate  student participants assigned study time and effort to a core‐course exam, to which their commitment  was certain and relatively high, or to an elective‐course exam, to which their commitment was uncertain  and relatively low. These students further focused their attention on either the 50% exam materials that  they had covered to date versus the exam materials they had not yet covered. It was found that for an  elective‐course exam, to which commitment was uncertain, emphasizing the accomplishment to date  (vs. to go) increased students’ motivation to study, as assessed by the time and effort that participants  were willing to put into studying. However, for a core‐course exam, emphasizing the actions to go (vs. to  date) increased the motivation to study (Figure 3). Apparently, emphasizing completed (vs. remaining)  actions increased the motivation to adhere to a goal when commitment was uncertain by signaling that  the goal was important. These uncommitted students followed a dynamic of highlighting and chose to  study because they had completed some coursework. In contrast, emphasizing remaining (vs.  completed) actions increased the motivation to adhere to a goal when commitment was certain by  signaling a need for progress. These committed participants followed a dynamic of balancing and chose  to study because they had remaining coursework that they had not yet completed.  Goal research often focuses on self‐regulation toward personal goals, such as pursuing academic  and health goals. However, similar processes should affect the regulation of group goals, which require a  group of people to invest their resources toward a common goal⎯for example, when raising  contributions for a charity. In such situations, a person’s motivation to invest resources can depend on </region>
      <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="50">others’ contributions or lack of contributions and what is missing to complete the goal. In addition,  social agents choose to emphasize contributions or a lack of contributions as part of their persuasive </outsider>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="51" confidence="possible">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  12 appeal. For example, fundraisers present information about the amount of donations they have  received thus far (i.e., seed money) or money that is still required to complete the fundraising goal.  People’s motivation to invest resources in a social goal should follow the same basic dynamics as the  motivation to work on a personal goal. That is, if they ask about their level of commitment, they are  more likely to invest resource if they consider others’ contributions versus the lack of contributions  because current contributions signify that the goal is important. However, if people ask about the level  of progress toward the social goal, they are more likely to invest resources if they consider the lack of  contribution because it signifies that more progress is required to achieve the goal.  To demonstrate effects on a group goal, Koo and Fishbach (2008, Study 4) conducted a field  study with the collaboration of Compassion Korea, a charity organization dedicated to helping children  in developing countries. As part of their study, Compassion initiated a campaign to help AIDS orphans in  Africa. The solicited population included regular donors, who were making monthly donations of $35 to  this charity (“hot list”), and new donors, who indicated their interest but had not yet made any  contribution (“cold list”). The two groups varied in terms of their commitment certainty, which was  higher for those on the hot list. The solicitation letter indicated that Compassion set a goal to raise 10  million won (approximately US$10,000) to help AIDS orphans in Africa and that approximately half of  the money had already been raised through various channels. Depending on the experimental condition,  half of the participants received a solicitation letter that emphasized the contributions to date (50%),  and the other half received a letter that emphasized the required contributions to complete the  campaign goal (again, 50%).  The results showed that among first‐time donors, whose commitment was uncertain, an  emphasis on accomplished contributions (50% to date) increased the frequency and the average </region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="53" confidence="possible">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  13 among regular donors, whose commitment was certain, an emphasis on unaccomplished actions (50%  to go) increased frequency and the average amount of donations more than an emphasis on  accomplished actions (50% to date). This pattern reflects a dynamic of balancing because a person’s  contribution increased if others did not contribute (see Figure 4 for the frequency data).  In summary, research on the information that the perceiver seeks shows that a person’s  commitment certainty determines his or her dynamic of self‐regulation. When commitment is uncertain,  people ask about commitment and follow a dynamic of highlighting the focal goal. As a result, the focus  on completed actions to date increases self‐regulatory effort more than the focus on remaining actions  to go. When, however, commitment is certain, people ask about progress and follow a dynamic of  balancing between progress toward the focal goal and attending to other goals. Then, the focus on  remaining actions to go increases self‐regulatory effort more than the focus on completed actions to  date.   The Information in the Goal Actions  The information that the perceiver seeks influences the dynamic of self‐regulation. In addition,  the characteristics of the situation influence the dynamic of self‐regulation that people choose to follow.  One such characteristic is the relative saliency of a concrete goal action versus the abstract, overall goal.  Some choice situations emphasize the concrete actions, whereas others emphasize the overall goals  (Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003; Vallacher &amp; Wegner, 1987). This emphasis influences the representation of  goals and the resultant dynamic of self‐regulation. Specifically, when an overall goal is salient, people  tend to represent goal actions in terms of commitment to the overall goal and highlight that goal, but  when the overall goal is not salient, people tend to represent goal actions in terms of progress on a  specific action and balance between the overall goal and other ones. </region>
      <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="54">In a study that tested this idea, Fishbach et al. (2006, Study 3) assessed participants’ motivation  to work on an academic achievement task after successfully completing, or not, a similar task. </outsider>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="55" confidence="possible">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  14 Participants completed two independent scrambled‐sentence tasks that represented two subgoals  toward an academic achievement goal. After completing the first task, they received bogus feedback on  their low or high success; then, their persistence on a second, similar task was assessed. Notably, unlike  the first task, the second task had no correct solutions, and thus task motivation could be inferred by the  time participants persisted on this frustrating task (Muraven, Tice, &amp; Baumeister, 1998). This study  found that when the focus was on the concrete action itself, success on the first task signaled progress  and substituted for exerting effort on the second task, such that participants quitted earlier after high  (vs. low) success. However, when the overall achievement goal was primed during the first task (Bargh &amp;  Chartrand, 2000; Srull &amp; Wyer, 1979), success on the first task signaled commitment and reinforced  participants’ motivation to exert more effort on the second task, and indeed participants persisted  longer after high (vs. low) success (see Figure 5). Further studies found that in addition to the  accessibility of an overall goal, merely considering goal pursuits that are temporally distant, and  therefore are represented in terms of more abstract goals (e.g., Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003), resulted in a  commitment (vs. progress) representation of goal actions and highlighting the same goal in successive  choices (Fishbach et al. 2006; Study 4; see also Zhang et al. 2007, Study 4).  Complementing Versus Competing Actions  In addition to the relative accessibility of the overall goal, another factor that influences the  dynamic of self‐regulation refers to the presentation of choice alternatives that pertain to different  underlying goals as either complementing each other or competing with each other. Whereas people  balance between complementing choice alternatives, they highlight the better alternative among  competing choice alternatives.   Specifically, when alternatives pertaining to different goals coexist, they can be included either </region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="57" confidence="possible">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  15 each other. When items appear together they seem to complement each other, and the resultant  dynamic is one of balancing, whereas when items appear apart they seem to compete with each other,  the resultant dynamic is one of highlighting (e.g., fruits and candies). For example, the presentation of  healthful and unhealthful food items together on the same plate activates the perception that these  items complement each other, and balancing is desirable. The presentation of these items in two  separate plates activates the perception that these items compete with each other, and highlighting is  desirable.  The perception of choice items as competing with or complementing each other has unique  consequences for self‐control conflicts and the pattern of self‐regulation among goals and temptations.  In a self‐control conflict, one goal is high order and offers delayed but larger benefits, and the other,  “temptation goal” is low order and offers immediate but smaller benefits (Ainslie, 1992; Baumeister,  Heatherton, &amp; Tice, 1994; Kivetz &amp; Simonson, 2002; Loewenstein, 1996; Metcalfe &amp; Mischel, 1999;  Rachlin, 2000; Thaler, 1991; Trope &amp; Fishbach, 2000). For example, studying offers delayed benefits and  procrastinating offers immediate, yet smaller benefits. In this conflict, highlighting entails that a person  persistently chooses goal items and expresses a positive evaluation of them because the goal is more  valuable in the long run. Balancing produces the opposite pattern of evaluation and choice, such that  the immediate choice and value of tempting options increase relative to the goal. The reason is that  under a balancing dynamic, the sequence of “first temptation, then goal” offers greater total benefits  than “first goal, then temptation.” That is, people can expect to maximize what they attain from both by  expressing an immediate preference for a tempting option and an intention to choose a goal option at  the next opportunity. As such, they capture the value of the temptation in the present and expect to  obtain the value of the goal in the future. </region>

They also  tested whether goal and temptation items that are presented together in the same choice set  complement each other and thus lead to a dynamic of balancing between the underlying motivations,  such that people express a preference for and positive evaluation of tempting items. In one study,  Fishbach and Zhang (2008, Study 3) asked participants to evaluate healthful and unhealthful courses on  a restaurant menu (e.g., edamame beans and fruit plate vs. bacon cheeseburger and chocolate mousse).  The menu either included all courses together in one section or separated the healthful and unhealthful  courses, which were presented apart in two different sections. In another (single) condition, participants  evaluated only half of the menu items⎯either healthful or unhealthful⎯and they came back to the lab  to evaluate the other half a few days later. The results showed that the relative value of the healthful  and unhealthful menu courses depended on presentation format. Although the value of these items was  similar when they were evaluated on separate days, presenting the two types of courses together, so  that they seemed to complement each other, increased the value of unhealthful courses. Conversely,  presenting the two types of courses apart, so that they seemed to compete with each other, increased  the value of healthful courses (see Figure 6).  In another study, Fishbach and Zhang (2008, Study 5) measured people’s choice of menu  courses as a function of the presentation format. In this study, they found that when the options were  presented together, the majority of the participants were balancing: they expressed a preference for a  tempting, unhealthful entrée for an immediate consumption, and a more healthful dessert for a delayed  consumption. However, when the options were presented apart, the majority of the participants were  highlighting: they expressed a preference for healthful menu courses for both an immediate entrée and  a delayed dessert. Thus, participants balanced between items that seemed to complement each other, </region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="61" confidence="possible">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  17 stimuli (e.g., study book vs. DVDs) or high‐brow versus low‐brow magazines (e.g., The Economist vs.  Cosmopolitan); thus, these findings are not unique to food items.  The aforementioned studies illustrate that the presentation of choice alternatives can influence  a person’s tendency to balance between the underlying goals and temptations or to highlight the most  important goal over successive choices that unfold over time. Importantly, in self‐control situations,  balancing may imply that a person resolves the conflict in favor of the temptation on each opportunity,  while repeatedly postponing selection of goal items to the future. For example, a student can decide to  procrastinate today and work on a paper tomorrow and repeat this choice every day, or a smoker can  decide to smoke now and forgo smoking in the future and repeat this decision at each opportunity. In  such situations, balancing results in self‐control relapses.  What is special about these self‐control failures is that people engage in a dynamic of balancing,  in which they do not perceive a conflict between goals and temptations. Rather, they perceive an  opportunity to give in to temptations in the present and capture the value of the goal in the future.  Therefore, these self‐control failures are the result of people’s failure to recognize a self‐control  problem. They are different from failures to exercise one’s will, because people do not try to restraint  and therefore do not incur the sense of failure (cf., ego depletion effects; Baumeister, this volume;  Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, &amp; Tice, 1998; Vohs, Baumeister, &amp; Ciarocco, 2005; Vohs, Lasaleta and  Fennis, this volume).

Correspondingly, people are  less likely to adhere to the goal to the extent that they have not selected goal actions before and infer  low commitment. Second, when goal actions signal that progress has been made toward the goal and  the discrepancy to goal attainment has been reduced, people relax their efforts. Correspondingly, they  are also more likely to adhere to the focal goal if they have not selected other goal actions and  experience need to progress. One conclusion is that that both acting on a goal and failing to do so can  potentially motivate further actions in pursuit of the goal, depending on the dynamic of self‐regulation  (i.e., highlighting vs. balancing).  The research reviewed here supports the operation of two dynamics of self‐regulation. This  research finds that when an action is indicative of commitment, it promotes similar choices and inhibits  competing goals (Shah et al., 2002), but when the same action is indicative of progress, it liberates a  person to disengage with the goal and attend to other goals (Khan &amp; Dhar, 2006; Monin &amp; Miller, 2001).  Notably, not only do completed actions affect present choice, but future plans also exert similar  influences. Thus, in a choice sequence, people choose to adhere to goals in the present after considering  completed or planned goal actions, or both.  There are several variables that determine the dynamic of self‐regulation that people follow,  and they reflect either the information the perceiver seeks or the information that is in the choice  situation. First, whether people ask about their level of commitment to the goal versus progress needed  for goal attainment, determines the interpretation of goal‐congruent actions as signaling one of the two.  When commitment is uncertain, people ask about commitment and they highlight, but when  commitment is certain, people ask whether progress has been made and they balance. Second, the  dynamic of self‐regulation depends on the information that is in the choice alternatives. When the </region>
      <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="67">overall goal is salient, any specific goal action is more likely to signal commitment to the goal than  progress toward the goal, and people highlight. But when the specific action is salient, its completion is </outsider>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="68" confidence="possible">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  19 more likely to signal progress or attainment than commitment, leading people to balance. Moreover,  even in the absence of an initial goal action, the presentation of choice alternatives that cue different  goals (or goals and temptations) can influence the representation of the underlying goals and the  dynamic of self‐regulation. When choice alternatives appear together in a unified choice set, they seem  to complement each other and people balance between the underlying goals. In self‐control situations,  this dynamic increases the preference for tempting alternatives. When choice alternatives are presented  apart in separate choice sets that are organized by the underlying goals, they seem to compete against  each other and people highlight the more important goal. This dynamic increases the preference for  alternatives that serve high‐order goals.  There are some remaining issues that my colleagues and I address in our ongoing study of the  dynamics of self‐regulation. First, this theoretical framework has implications for the already‐classic  question of what determines people’s level of aspiration (Kruglanski, 1975; Lewin, Dembo, Festinger, &amp;  Sears, 1944). Koo and Fishbach (2008) provide some new insights into this classic problem by proposing  that in a commitment representation of goals, people adhere to their goal because they derive value  from the actual engagement, whereas in a progress representation of goals, people adhere to their goal  because they derive value from goal completion and moving on to a more advanced level. For example,  in a commitment frame, college students study because they derive satisfaction from expanding their  knowledge, whereas in a progress frame, students derive satisfaction from completing their academic  requirements, which is a step in developing their professional career. It follows that a progress frame is  associated with a higher level of aspiration. Moreover, there should be a trade‐off between the  satisfaction from pursuing the goal in a commitment frame and the satisfaction from completing a goal  in the progress frame. A progress frame is ultimately associated with a higher level of aspiration, but it </region>
      <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="69">should also be associated with extrinsic motivation, focus on goal completion, and receiving the benefits  from completing the goal. Conversely, a commitment frame is associated with a lower level of aspiration </outsider>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="70" confidence="possible">The Dynamics of Self‐Regulation  20 but greater intrinsic value of the goal itself (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985; Sansone &amp; Harackiewicz, 2000; Sansone,  this volume; Shah &amp; Kruglanski, 2000).  This theoretical framework has further implications for mood and self‐regulation and, in  particular, when do positive versus negative moods increase the motivation to adhere to a goal. Eyal,  Fishbach and Labroo (2008) found that when people attribute their mood to progress toward a goal,  positive mood signals that progress has been made more than negative mood, and happy individuals  relax their efforts. However, when, people attribute their mood to an unrelated source, mood has the  opposite effect. That is, positive mood signals goal commitment more than negative mood, and happy  individuals invest more efforts on the goal (see also Fishbach &amp; Labroo, 2007).  This theoretical framework is not limited to personal goals. It has implications for group  phenomena and what motivates people to join forces with other group members to pursue goals that  are subscribed by society, such as environmental issues or helping the poor. Recently, Koo, Fishbach and  Henderson (2008) found that people’s motivation to adhere to group goals depends on their level of  identification with the group. When people have high levels of identification, they monitor goal progress  and therefore, an emphasis on other group members’ lack of (vs. existing) contributions, increases their  own contributions through balancing. Conversely, when people have low levels of group identification,  they evaluate the commitment to the goal and an emphasis of others’ existing (vs. lack of) contributions  signals commitment, thus it increases contributions through highlighting. In general then, this  framework has implications for the pursuit of group goals and phenomena such as social loafing and  social facilitation.  </region>
