      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="5" confidence="possible">Empirical evidence on selective exposure to information after decisions is contradictory: Whereas many studies have found a preference for information that is consistent with one’s prior decision, some have found a preference for inconsistent information. The authors propose that different available information quantities moderate these contradictory findings. Four studies confirmed this expectation. When confronted with 10 pieces of information, decision makers systematically preferred decision-consistent information, whereas when confronted with only 2 pieces of information, they strongly preferred decision-inconsistent information (Study 1). This effect was not due to differences in processing complexity (Study 2) or dissonance processes (Study 3) but could be traced back to different salient selection criteria: When confronted with 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was information direction (consistent vs. inconsistent), which caused a preference for inconsistent information. In contrast, when confronted with more than 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was expected information quality, which caused a preference for consistent information (Study 4).

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="53" page="1" column="2">A great deal of empirical research on selective exposure to information has been conducted in the context of dissonance theory ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="27" class="deo:Reference">Festinger, 1957</xref>, 1964; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="28" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="29" class="deo:Reference">Jonas et al., 2001</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="30" class="deo:Reference">D’Alessio &amp; Allen, 2002</xref>). Dissonance theory suggests that subsequent to having made a decision, decision makers experience cognitive dissonance because of the salient negative aspects of the selected alternative and the salient positive aspects of the rejected alternative. Dissonance is experienced as an aversive affective<marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> state that motivates people to reduce it. One prominent means of reducing dissonance is selective exposure to consistent information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="36" class="deo:Reference">Festinger, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="37" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>). In the standard research paradigm (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="38" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1981a</xref>, 1981b, 1981c; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="39" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="40" class="deo:Reference">Jonas et al., 2001</xref>), participants are confronted with a decision problem that requires them to decide between two different alternatives (e.g., whether the contract of a manager should be extended or not or whether a company should invest in Developing Country A or B). They are asked to make a preliminary or final decision and afterward have the opportunity to freely search for additional decision-consistent and decision-inconsistent information among a set of equally distributed consistent and inconsistent pieces of information (e.g., 6 consistent and 6 inconsistent pieces of information; cf. Fischer, Jonas, Frey, &amp; Schulz- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="41" class="deo:Reference">Hardt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="42" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>). Selective exposure to supporting information occurs when participants systematically select more consistent than inconsistent pieces of decision-relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="43" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="44" class="deo:Reference">Jonas et al., 2001</xref>). So far, various variables have been identified that increase the tendency to prefer consistent information after decision making, for example, strong commit- ment to a position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="45" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>; Schwarz, Frey, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="46" class="deo:Reference">Kumpf, 1980</xref>), situations with high freedom of choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="47" class="deo:Reference">Cotton &amp; Hieser, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="48" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1981b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="49" class="deo:Reference">Frey &amp; Wicklund, 1978</xref>), when decisions are irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="50" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1981c</xref>), or when individuals are in negative affective states (Jonas, Graupmann, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="51" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 2006</xref>). 1 In striking contrast to the overall preference for consistent information found in the above-mentioned studies, as well as in many others, an influential research program conducted by Freedman (1965) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="52" class="deo:Reference">Sears (1965)</xref> consistently found that people systematically prefer information that is inconsistent with their decisions and standpoints. For example, in the Freedman study, participants listened to an interview with a college student who had applied for an international conference abroad. The student was described as either rather competent or incompetent. Participants then had to decide whether the student’s request should be granted or not. Subsequently, 2 additional pieces of information were available: 1 consistent and 1 inconsistent with their prior decision. Participants were instructed to choose only 1 piece of information. Contrary to the selective-exposure hypothesis of dissonance theory, a strong preference for inconsistent information was observed: 94% of all participants selected the inconsistent piece of information. Corresponding results were obtained by Sears, who used a similar information-seeking paradigm in the context of a legal decision case. Participants had to decide whether a defendant was guilty or not and subsequently had the chance to select either decision-consistent or decision-inconsistent information. As in the Freedman study, a similar strong preference for inconsistent information was observed. As a consequence, the contradictory results of this research program subsequently led to a significant decrease in interest in selective-exposure effects. These differences call for an examination of why this research program by Freedman and Sears yielded results at odds with those found in corresponding dissonance research.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="68" page="2" column="2">We propose that there are three possible psychological processes that could underlie the expected moderating effect of information quantity on selective exposure: (a) differences due to the amount of aroused dissonance and threat, (b) differences in processing complexity, and (c) different activated selection criteria. In the following, we outline these different potential psychological processes. Dissonance and threat explanation. From the perspective of dissonance theory, the differential effect of information quantity on the preference for decision-consistent versus decision- inconsistent information could be explained by (a) different refutation strategies as well as (b) differences in dissonance (threat) arousal. With regard to (a), refuting inconsistent information is the most effective way to achieve an enduring and stable reduction in post-decisional dissonance (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="67" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>). Hence, when decision makers are confronted with only 2 (1 consistent and 1 inconsistent)</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="79" confidence="possible" page="2" column="2">1 Selective exposure to information should not be mixed up with a positive test strategy in hypothesis testing (e.g., Devine, Hirt, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="69" class="deo:Reference">Gehrke, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="70" class="deo:Reference">Klayman &amp; Ha, 1987</xref>; Slowiaczek, Klayman, Sherman, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42" id="71" class="deo:Reference">Skov, 1992</xref>). In research on information search in the context of social hypothesis testing, participants are asked to test hypotheses about other people, for example, whether a person is an extrovert or an introvert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43" id="72" class="deo:Reference">Snyder &amp; Swann, 1978</xref>). If participants test the hypothesis that a specific person is an extrovert, they are systematically inclined to ask questions about typical extrovert rather than introvert behaviors. In contrast, when participants test the introvert hypothesis, they systematically ask more questions about introvert rather than extrovert behaviors. To put it differently, individuals ask questions that, in case of a positive answer, would confirm the hypothesis under consideration. In significant contrast to the present selective exposure to information paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="73" class="deo:Reference">Festinger, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="74" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="75" class="deo:Reference">Jonas et al., 2001</xref>), a person asking hypothesis-consistent questions does not know in advance whether the answer will be consistent or inconsistent to the hypothesis under consideration. In addition, previous research has revealed that the employment of a positive test strategy does not depend on a person’s own opinion: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41" id="76" class="deo:Reference">Semin and Strack (1980)</xref> have shown that even if the hypothesis tester is made to believe that the target is an extrovert, the tester still asks more questions about introvert behaviors because the experimental task was to test whether the target person is an introvert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41" id="77" class="deo:Reference">Semin &amp; Strack, 1980</xref>). In sum, positive hypothesis testing is a tendency that is phenomenologically as well as conceptually significantly different from selective exposure to information (see also Schulz-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="78" class="deo:Reference">Hardt et al., 2007</xref>).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="102" page="3" column="1">pieces of information, the most effective way to bring about a long-lasting reduction in dissonance is to refute the inconsistent information. However, if the number of pieces of available inconsistent information increases, selecting and refuting all of the inconsistent information becomes more and more difficult due to limited cognitive resources and time constraints. In addition, if only 1 piece of information can be chosen, selecting and subsequently refuting this 1 piece of inconsistent information would still leave several remaining inconsistent pieces of information nonrefuted. Consequently, increasing the number of pieces of inconsistent information should result in a stronger preference for consistent information, which (next to refuting all inconsistent pieces of information) offers the second-best opportunity to reduce dissonance (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="83" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>). With regard to the differences in dissonance arousal, in the 2-information condition, the potential for dissonance or threat arousal is comparatively low because only 1 piece of inconsistent or threatening information exists for the decision maker. In contrast, conditions with more than 1 inconsistent piece of information should lead to a comparatively higher degree of postdecision dissonance because several inconsistent pieces of information exist for the decision maker. Hence, because of higher dissonance and threat arousal in the 10-information condition, decision makers should be more inclined to select the consistent piece of information than they would be in the less dissonance and threat arousing 2-information condition. Complexity explanation. This explanation assumes that the preference for consistent information gets stronger with an increasing degree of complexity in the decision task and in the associated information-seeking process. Increasing quantities of available decision-relevant information (as is the case in selective-exposure studies with more than 2 pieces of available information) increase the complexity of decision tasks. High complexity, in turn, increases the need for closure (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="84" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski &amp; Webster, 1996</xref>), which represents a motivation to reduce decision complexity by “freezing” a decision alternative as fast as possible. Thereby, an effective way to reduce cognitive complexity in decision making is to predominantly search for decision-consistent information, which helps to bolster one’s own decision. In summary, according to the complexity explanation, studies with a larger number of available decision-relevant pieces of information increase decision complexity, which in turn might trigger decision makers’ need for closure and thus lead to an increased preference for consistent information. Selection-criteria explanation. This explanation is based on the assumption that different information quantities trigger different selection criteria for information search, which in turn result in different information preferences. Furthermore, it is assumed that the use of selection criteria for information search follows the principle of minimum effort. Correspondingly, people choose among possible selection criteria the one that best differentiates between the available pieces of information. If there is more than one selection criterion that fits this description, decision makers choose the one that entails the least processing effort. We propose that two selection criteria are particularly relevant for our experimental situations: (a) information quality and (b) information direction. With regard to information quality, previous research has consistently revealed that information search can be strongly determined by the assessment of expected information quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="85" class="deo:Reference">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>; Schulz-Hardt, Fischer, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="86" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 2007</xref>). That is,<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> on the basis of main arguments (which are the typical basis for information search), decision makers often try to find the qualita- tively best decision-relevant information in their information search. However, because of a basically more critical testing of inconsistent information (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="88" class="deo:Reference">Ditto &amp; Lopez, 1992</xref>; Ditto, Scepansky, Munro, Apanovitch, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="89" class="deo:Reference">Lockhart, 1998</xref>) and a systematic skewing of a priori knowledge toward one’s own standpoints (cf. Chaiken, Giner-Sorolla, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="90" class="deo:Reference">Chen, 1996</xref>; Chaiken, Liberman, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="91" class="deo:Reference">Eagly, 1989</xref>), consistent information normally has a general advantage in the assessment of information quality and thus is systematically preferred in information search (given information quality is the salient selection criterion; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="92" class="deo:Reference">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>; Schulz-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="93" class="deo:Reference">Hardt et al., 2007</xref>). With regard to information direction, other research has revealed that decision makers show balanced information search (or even a preference for inconsistent information) when they try to be or to appear as unbiased decision makers and information processors (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="94" class="deo:Reference">Kunda, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35" id="95" class="deo:Reference">Pyszczynski &amp; Greenberg, 1987</xref>). Thus, a high salience of information direction (in contrast to a high salience of information quality) might increase decision makers’ attempts to be and/or appear balanced and unbiased, which in turn should increase their striving for inconsistent information. Transferred to our experimental situation with only 2 versus more than 2 (e.g., 10) pieces of information, these considerations imply the following: Given 2 available pieces of information (1 decision consistent, 1 decision inconsistent), decision makers do not need to consider expected information quality (which is effortful to detect) as a selection criterion. Instead they can use the more easily detectable information direction, which fully distinguishes between the available pieces of information. If information direction is the salient selection criterion, a preference for inconsistent information should prevail because the decision maker tries to be (or at least to seem to be) unbiased, objective, and fair in their information processing (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="96" class="deo:Reference">Kunda, 1990</xref>; Pyszczynski &amp; Greenberg, 1987). In contrast, given the situation where more than 2 pieces of information (e.g., 10) are available (half of them supporting and half conflicting with the prior decision), the information direction does not fully distinguish among the available pieces of information anymore. That is, on the basis of information direction alone, it is not possible for the decision maker to identify and select the most relevant piece of information. As a consequence, the decision maker uses the more effortful evaluation of the expected information quality in order to decide which piece of information to choose. Hence, because consistent information mostly appears to be of higher quality than inconsistent information (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="97" class="deo:Reference">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>; Lord, Ross, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32" id="98" class="deo:Reference">Lepper, 1979</xref>), an increased preference for consistent information should emerge in conditions with more than 2 pieces of available consistent and inconsistent information (e.g., in classic conditions with 10 pieces of information––5 consistent and 5 inconsistent with the partici- pant’s decision or standpoint). The following studies were designed to test whether different quantities of decision-relevant information moderate differences between studies that find a preference for decision-consistent information and studies that find a preference for decision- inconsistent information (Studies 1– 4). Furthermore, we investi- gated the psychological processes that underlie this expected effect; we tested whether the expected effect of information quantity on information preferences is due to complexity processes<marker type="page" number="4"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> (Study 2), dissonance and threat processes (Study 3), or different salient selection criteria (Studies 2– 4).</region>

Sixty-four students (38 women and 26 men, 16 to 32 years of age) from a high school in Kiel and the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich (both cities located in Germany) participated in this experiment.

In order to keep our experimental material as close as possible to the material used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="111" class="deo:Reference">Sears (1965)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="112" class="deo:Reference">Freedman (1965)</xref>, participants were confronted with a legal decision case that was slightly adapted to the German legal system. The decision case contained a hearing of evidence concerning the death of Mr. Schulz, a 19-year-old insurance broker, who lived with his father. Mr. Schulz’s father was unemployed, which contributed to the violent climate within the family: Fights between father and son were common. In a recent fight, Mr. Schulz succumbed to a fatal knife wound. The father then faced court charged with murder. However, it was unclear whether the son’s death was murder or manslaughter. Unfortunately, the only possible eyewitness—Mr. Schulz’s mother— had been struck on the head during the fight and was thus unconscious for most of it. Evidence procured from the scene of the incident was ambiguous. 2 After participants had read the legal case study, they finally decided whether Mr. Schulz was murdered by his father or not. Afterward, participants were informed that either 2 or 10 pieces of additional information concerning the court proceeding were available. Each piece of information was characterized by a main thesis containing information direction (i.e., whether they were consistent or inconsistent with the prior decision) and a short explanation. Participants learned that these main theses represented one full page of more detailed statements and were appraisals by legal experts who were familiar with the court proceedings. An example of a piece of information implying that the father killed Mr. Schulz is as follows: “Mr. Schulz fought with his father on numerous occasions. This should be evidence enough of the guilt of the father.” An example assuming the innocence of the father is as<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> follows: “We have no fingerprints on the knife and no witnesses. Without such evidence, Mr. Schulz’s father should be released.” In both conditions, half of the statements spoke for and half spoke against a conviction of Mr. Schulz. Hence, irrespective of the participants’ previous decision, half of the pieces of information were consistent and half were inconsistent with this decision. The participants could select only 1 piece of information— either a consistent or an inconsistent one. Please note that this instruction to select only 1 piece of information is very important and necessary to keep information-search conditions comparable, otherwise (under conditions of free choice) information search (i.e., number of pieces of information that could be selected) and information quantity (number of pieces of information to which participants are exposed) would be confounded. After information selection, the experiment ended and participants were debriefed, thanked for their participation, and dismissed.</region>

In showing that the preference for consistent versus inconsistent information systematically depends on the amount of available information, Study 1 suggests that information quantity is the crucial moderator between studies that find a preference for decision-consistent information and those that find a preference for decision-inconsistent information. The following studies were designed to replicate this finding with different decision cases and, most importantly, to identify the differential psychological processes underlying this moderator effect.</region>

Processing and testing 10 pieces of information should be more complex and laborious than processing only 2 pieces of information. From previous research, we know that conditions that render information processing difficult and labori- ous—such as time restrictions or noise—increase the preference for consistent information (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="127" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski &amp; Webster, 1996</xref>). This tendency is explained by the psychological construct “need for cognitive closure,” which reflects an individual’s need for a strong and definite answer to a specific question as well as ambiguity aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29" id="128" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="129" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski &amp; Webster, 1996</xref>). Ac- cording to this line of argumentation, conditions that enhance cognitive complexity increase the need for cognitive closure and thus increase the preference for consistent information. Transferred to the present research, and compared to the 2-information condition, participants confronted with 10 pieces of decision- relevant information might have experienced higher cognitive complexity and therefore an increased need for cognitive closure. In order to reduce cognitive complexity and reach cognitive closure, they might systematically prefer decision-consistent information. In contrast, participants in the 2-information condition should have experienced less cognitive complexity, less need for closure, and therefore a decreased preference for consistent information. One way to specifically test this complexity explanation is to design an experimental condition that is almost as low in complexity as the 2-information condition, but (a) does not provide information direction as a selection criterion that fully distinguishes between the available decision-relevant pieces of information (see Selection-criteria explanation above), and (b) does not give the information seeker the possibility to refute all inconsistent information (see Dissonance and threat explanation above). A condition that possesses these attributes is when participants are confronted with 4 pieces of information (2 consistent and 2 inconsistent with the preliminary decision). The cognitive complexity of this condition is quite similar to the low cognitive complexity of the 2-information condition but simultaneously does not allow information direction to completely distinguish between the available pieces of information nor does it allow complete dissonance<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> reduction by refuting all available pieces of inconsistent information (because decision makers can only select 1 piece of information). In order to test the validity of the complexity explanation, participants in Study 2 made a preliminary decision and then selected 1 piece of information among either 2, 4, or 10 decision- relevant (half consistent and half inconsistent) pieces of information. If the cognitive-complexity explanation is valid, then participants should reveal a more or less similar information-search pattern both in the 2- and the 4-information condition—namely a systematic preference for inconsistent information (in other words: information search patterns in the 4-information condition should differ from the 10-information condition). If the dissonance or the selection-criteria explanation is valid, then a preference for consistent information should occur not only in the 10-information condition but also in the 4-information condition (i.e., no difference should occur between information-search patterns in the 4- and 10-information condition). Moreover, in order to get additional information about the participants’ subjective reasons for their information selection, we asked them in an open-ended question, after decision making and information selection, about why they had selected that particular piece of information.</region>

The participants were asked to participate in a study on decision making that took place after a social psychology lecture.

Participants were<marker type="page" number="6"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> informed that the aim of the study was to evaluate and discuss typical arguments on the question of whether tuition fees should be introduced in Germany or not. After this short introduction, participants indicated on a checkbox whether they were in favor of or against the introduction of tuition fees. Please note that participants were informed that this decision was preliminary and that after information search (which would help them to optimize their decision), they would have the chance to revise their decision (at the end of the experiment). This instruction should have ensured that participants were convinced that the goal of information search was to increase the probability of making a correct final decision. Subsequently, they were informed that after the study, they would be interviewed on the topic of tuition fees by one of the experimenters. However, in order to prepare for this short interview, participants could gather 1 (out of 2, 4, or 10) additional piece of information concerning this decision problem. 3 The additional pieces of information were said to consist of one-page statements written by students from the Ludwig- Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. Each statement was summarized by a main thesis of two sentences. The main thesis contained the main argument of the corresponding statement and made it clear whether the author of the statement was in favor of or against the introduction of tuition fees. Participants were ex- plicitly instructed that they could select only 1 piece of information. An example of a main thesis in favor of the introduction of fees is as follows: “Tuition fees are a good thing because they would increase the quality of research and teaching. Thus, German universities would be more competitive on an international level.” An example of a main thesis against the introduction of fees is as follows: “One shouldn’t introduce tuition fees because this would transform universities into commercial organizations. As a consequence, matters of profitability rather than teaching and research would be the focus of German universities.” Thus, irrespective of whether the participants were in favor of or against an introduction of tuition fees, half of the statements supported their decision and half conflicted with it. Participants indicated in a checkbox which pieces of information they wanted to read in full; after information selection, a final decision was made. Finally, participants were asked in an open-ended question to write down why they had selected their specific piece of information. Afterward, they were<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> informed that the experiment was over and that there was no need to conduct an interview.</region>

Reported selection criteria. Participants’ answers on the open- ended question concerning the subjective reason for their information selection were coded by two independent raters. The raters decided whether the answer was quality related (e.g., participants wrote that they wanted to get the best piece of information or mentioned the interesting information content as the selection criterion) or direction related (e.g., participants indicated that they wanted to read a piece of information that supported or contradicted their own decision). An- swers that were neither quality nor direction related were also coded but, because of their very low frequency, not included in subsequent analyses. Overall, the raters agreed in 66 of 69 cases, representing an overlap of more than 95%. Finally, inconsistent rater assessments were resolved by discussion. Overall, a significant correlation was found between the type of information selected (consistent vs. inconsistent) and type of reported selection criterion (direction related vs. quality related; Spearman’s r .36, p .004). That is, when participants selected a consistent piece of information, they were more inclined to report a quality-related selection criterion. In contrast, when participants selected an inconsistent piece of information, they were more inclined to report a direction-related selection criterion. Moreover, a chi-square analysis of the experimental conditions (2 vs. 4 vs. 10 pieces of information) and type of reported selection criterion revealed a significant two-way interaction, 2 (2, N 61) 6.87, p .03. Further analyses, conducted separately for the three experimental conditions, revealed that participants in the 10-information condition reported more quality-related (71%) than direction-related (29%) selection criteria for information search, 2 (1, N 21) 3.86, p .05. The same pattern was found in the 4-information condition (quality-related: 78%; direction-related: 22%), 2 (1, N 18) 5.56, p .02. In contrast, participants in the 2-information condition reported somewhat more direction- related selection criteria (59%) than quality-related selection criteria (41%), although this difference failed to reach significance, 2 (1, N 22) 0.73, p .39. In sum, Study 2 revealed a slight, though nonsignificant, preference for inconsistent information in the 2-information condition (i.e., balanced information search) and a significant preference for consistent information in the 4-information condition as well as in the 10- information condition. It was demonstrated that a significant preference for consistent information emerged as soon as participants were confronted with more than 2 pieces of information. Because no different information-search pattern could be observed between the conditions with 4 and 10 pieces of information, the effect of information quantity on information preference is unlikely to be mediated by differences due to differences in cognitive complexity. An open- ended question provided initial support for the validity of the pro- posed selection-criteria explanation.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="166" page="7" column="1">In the next study, we succeeded in collecting more direct evidence for our main assumption that the differential information <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> search in the 2- versus 10-information condition is based on different salient selection criteria, and, in addition, we tested whether the 2- versus 10-information effect could also alterna- tively be due to dissonance processes. From the perspective of dissonance theory, the effect of information quantity on the preference for consistent versus inconsistent information could emerge as follows: When people are confronted with only 1 inconsistent and 1 consistent piece of information, then (a) the potential for dissonance arousal and threat is comparatively low because only 1 piece of inconsistent information exists for the decision maker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="154" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>), and (b) refuting that 1 piece of inconsistent information is the most efficient way to reach long-lasting dissonance reduction (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="155" class="deo:Reference">Festinger, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="156" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>). If the only existing piece of inconsistent information can be refuted, no further sources of potential dissonance arousal remain. In contrast, conditions with more than 1 inconsistent piece of information should lead to (a) a comparatively higher degree of postdecisional dissonance because several inconsistent pieces of information exist and (b) a refutation strategy that is an ineffective way of achieving dissonance reduction because even if 1 inconsistent piece of information were refuted, several pieces of nonrefuted inconsistent information would still remain (because in our classic paradigm, decision makers can only choose 1 piece of additional information). As a consequence, selecting a consistent piece of information should be the most efficient way to achieve dissonance reduction in conditions with more than 1 consistent and 1 inconsistent piece of information. Instead of the dissonance explanation, we propose an alternative explanation that is based on different selection criteria. This alternative explanation is derived from the hypothesis that information search follows the minimum-effort principle and, therefore, decision makers try to select the piece of information that best differentiates among all available pieces of information. If there is more than one selection criterion that fits this description, decision makers choose the one that requires the least processing effort. In the 2-information condition, information direction completely distinguishes between both available pieces of information and requires less cognitive effort than assessing the information quality of the pieces of information individually. Therefore, decision makers’ information search should be guided by information direction, which, however, triggers individuals’ desire to be and/or appear self-critical and unbiased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="157" class="deo:Reference">Kunda, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35" id="158" class="deo:Reference">Pyszczynski &amp; Greenberg, 1987</xref>) and thus leads to a systematic preference for inconsistent information. However, given that more than 1 consistent and 1 inconsistent piece of decision-relevant information exist, information direction no longer completely differentiates the available pieces of information. Hence, decision makers should switch to the cognitively more demanding assessment of information quality as the crucial selection criterion. However, because previous research has shown that consistent information is generally assessed to be of higher quality than inconsistent information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="159" class="deo:Reference">Ditto &amp; Lopez, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="160" class="deo:Reference">Ditto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="161" class="deo:Reference">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>; Schulz-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="162" class="deo:Reference">Hardt et al., 2007</xref>), in conditions with more than 2 available pieces of information, individuals are expected to systematically prefer a consistent piece of information. The following research design, which varies as to whether in the 2- versus 10-information condition information content is given or not, helps to empirically distinguish between both the dissonance explanation and the selection-criteria explanation: If the 2- versus<marker type="page" number="8"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> 10-information effect is due to different selection criteria, and therefore partially based on biased assessment of information quality in the condition with 10 pieces of information, then removing information content as a possible selection criterion–– which means that evaluation of information quality is no longer possible––should reduce the preference for consistent information in that condition. However, if the 2- versus 10-information effect is due to dissonance processes, it should make no difference whether participants are provided with both information direction and detailed information content or with information direction only (without information content), because dissonance arousal is mostly a function of information direction (i.e., whether the information is consistent or inconsistent with one’s own standpoint). In short, the manipulation of information content should have no impact on the 2- versus 10-information effect if it is due to dissonance processes. In contrast, it should eliminate the preference for consistent information in the 10-information condition, as that effect is partially based on the biased assessment of information quality (i.e., different selection criteria).</region>

The participants were asked to imagine themselves in the role of a fashion store owner and to decide whether the contract of a manager (Mr. Miller) should be extended or not. They received a questionnaire containing an introduction to the topic and the most important facts about Mr. Miller’s work: Mr. Miller had been hired to manage a fashion store 1 year ago. Mr. Miller’s contract had been limited to a 1-year term; after that year, negotiations were to be conducted to discuss a possible extension of the contract. The participants were told that the success of Mr. Miller’s work was mixed. For example, he had succeeded in gaining new customers for the store by introducing a new product line (“Young Fashion”). However, at the same time, some of the store’s regular customers had been lost because they did not accept Mr. Miller’s “Men’s Fashion” collection. Positive and negative aspects of Mr. Miller’s work were balanced overall. After participants had read these facts, they were asked to make a preliminary decision as to whether Mr. Miller’s contract should be extended or not (participants were also informed that following their information search, they would have the opportunity to revise their decision at the end of the experiment). Afterward, participants were informed that additional information concerning the decision problem was available (which would help them to make their final decision). The additional pieces of information consisted of either 2 or 10 one-page statements written<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> by Mr. Miller’s colleagues. Each statement was summarized by a main thesis of two sentences. The main thesis contained the main argument of the corresponding statement and made it obvious whether the expert was in favor of or against an extension of the contract. Irrespective of whether the participants were in favor of or against an extension of the contract, half of the statements (either 1 or 5) supported their decision and the other half conflicted with it. Accordingly, the experimental manipulation of information quantity took place according to the number of statements presented (2 vs. 10). Moreover, the factor Information Content was manipulated as follows: The short description of the available pieces of information contained either both the information direction and the corresponding main argument (information content given) or only the information direction without any explanation (information content not given). An example of a piece of information with information content provided is as follows: “Mr. Miller has made the best out of the current difficult economic situation. Therefore, his contract should be extended.” An example of a piece of information with no information content provided is as follows: “Mr. Miller’s contract should not be extended.” In the first case, participants could use two different selection criteria, namely information quality (inferred from the argument “Mr. Miller has made the best of the currently difficult economic situation”) and information direction (apparent in the statement “Mr. Miller’s contract should be extended”). In the latter case, information direction (“Mr. Miller’s contract should not be extended”) was the only possible selection criterion. After information selection, participants made a final decision on whether the contract of the manager should be extended or not. After the experiment was over, all participants were debriefed, informed why it was not necessary to read the selected pieces of information, and given a cup of coffee and a chocolate bar as a token of our thanks for their participation.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="182" page="8" column="2">Of the 109 participants, 4 had to be excluded from further analyses. Two of them failed to fill in the questionnaire completely and a further 2 had suspicions regarding the aim of the study. Thus the sample size for analysis was 105. Information selection was not significantly associated with participants’ decision or participants’ gender (all 2 s 1). For an overview concerning information search as a function of the experimental conditions, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" id="172" class="deo:Reference">Figure 3</xref>. A 2 2 2-factorial log linear analysis revealed a significant three-way interaction among the factors Information Quantity (2 vs. 10), Information Content (given vs. not given), and Information Selection (consistent vs. inconsistent), Z 2.31, confidence interval ( 3.80, 0.31), SE 0.89, p .02. Two chi-square analyses, conducted separately for conditions with and without information content, revealed a significant interaction between the factors Information Quantity and Information Selection for only the condition with information content provided, 2 (1, N 55) 16.78, p .001; participants in the 2-information condition selected the inconsistent piece of information significantly more often (68%) than they did the consistent piece (32%), 2 (1, N 31) 3.90, p .048, whereas participants in the 10-information condition selected a consistent piece of information significantly more often (88%) than they did an inconsistent one (12%), 2 (1, N 24) 13.50,<marker type="page" number="9"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> p .001. This replicates the classic information-quantity effect from Studies 1 and 2. In contrast, in the conditions where information content was not provided, no significant interaction occurred between the factors Information Quantity and Information Selection, 2 (1, N 50) 0.74, p .39. In both the 2-information condition (consistent: 36%; inconsistent: 64%), 2 (1, N 25) 1.96, p .16, and the 10-information condition (consistent: 48%; inconsistent: 52%), 2 (1, N 25) 0.04, p .84, inconsistent pieces of information were selected slightly, but nonsignificantly, more frequently. Two additional chi-square analyses, conducted separately for conditions with 2 and 10 pieces of information, revealed a significant interaction between the factors Information Content and Information Selection for only the 10-information condition, 2 (1, N 49) 8.69, p .01, indicating that participants in the 10-information condition with information content provided selected significantly more consistent (88%) than inconsistent pieces of information (12%), 2 (1, N 24) 13.50, p .001. In contrast, participants in the 10-information condition with no information content provided did not select significantly more consistent (48%) than inconsistent pieces of information (52%), 2 (1, N 25) 0.04, p .84. Moreover, for the 2-information condition, no significant interaction occurred between the factors Information Content and Information Selection, 2 (1, N 56) 0.09, p .76. In both the 2-information condition with information content given (consistent: 32%; inconsistent: 68%), 2 (1, N 31) 3.90, p .048, and with no information content given (consistent: 36%; inconsistent: 64%), 2 (1, N 25) 1.96, p .16, participants selected more inconsistent than consistent pieces of information (please note that this tendency was significant for the information content given condition but not significant for the information content not given condition). In summary, Study 3 revealed that the 2- versus 10-information effect is not likely to be due to dissonance or threat-related processes because it was differentially affected by the information- content manipulation. That is, given that information content and information direction were both presented, the basic 2- versus 10-information effect of the previous two experiments was replicated. However, if the main argument was missing (no information<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> content), differences in information selection disappeared and a slightly (though not significantly) increased selection rate of inconsistent pieces of information was observed for both the 2-information and 10-information conditions. Hence, Study 3 provides further evidence that quality aspects are a crucial selection criterion in the 10-information condition, which thus supports the idea of our selection-criteria explanation.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="190" page="9" column="2">Finally, we conducted a fourth study that directly tested the validity of the selection-criteria explanation by manipulating both the salience of information direction and information quality as a selection criterion in the 2- and 10-information conditions. If conditions with 2 versus more than 2 (e.g., 4 or 10) pieces of information trigger different selection criteria and thus account for different information preferences in the 2- versus 10-information conditions, then the direct experimental manipulation of these two selection criteria (information direction vs. information quality) should directly affect information search, whereas the effect of information quantity on information preference should be simultaneously eliminated. This experimental logic is analogous to the logic of mediational analysis ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="184" class="deo:Reference">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). The mediator variable (i.e., different salient selection criteria) should be connected to the dependent variable (i.e., information preference). That is, a direct manipulation of the mediator variable should lead to the same effect in the dependent variable as a manipulation of the independent variable (i.e., information quantity). In addition, if the effect of the mediator variable is statistically controlled for, the effect of the independent variable (information quantity) on the dependent variable (information preference) should be eliminated. In order to provide such a test, we conducted the following experiment. As in Study 3, participants made a personnel decision about the future career of Mr. Miller and subsequently selected 1 out of either 2 or 10 pieces of information, half supporting and half conflicting with their prior decision. In addition, participants were instructed to base their information selection on either information direction (direction focus) or information quality (quality focus). A control group received no additional instructions. If an increased<marker type="page" number="10"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> salience of information direction is associated with an increased desire to appear unbiased and therefore causes a systematic preference for inconsistent information, then the direction focus should lead to a preference for inconsistent information in both the 2- and 10-information conditions. In contrast, given the quality focus, a systematic preference for consistent information was expected for the 2- as well as the 10-information condition due to the general expected quality advantage of consistent information.</region>

One hundred and fifty five (112 women and 43 men, ages ranged from 19 to 49 years; M 25.25, SD 5.28) students from Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany, participated in this experiment. All participants were recruited on the university campus by asking whether they would be willing to participate in a study on decision making at the nearby Department of Psychology. The experiment was based on a 2 (information quantity: 2 vs. 10) 3 (induced selection criterion: quality focus vs. direction focus vs. no focus induction) between-subjects design. Participants were randomly assigned to one of six experimental conditions. Procedure. As in Study 3, the Miller case was used. After the introduction and preliminary decision on whether the contract of the manager, Mr. Miller, should be extended or not (participants were informed that following their information search they could revise their preliminary decision), participants selected from 2 or 10 pieces of information that provided additional consistent and inconsistent information concerning their prior decision. However, in order to manipulate quality or direction salience, we had them read different instructions prior to information selection. The instruction for the quality focus was as follows: “Very important: please compare the available pieces of information with regard to their quality and select the one that is the best in your opinion, that is, the one which you consider to be most important, most credible, and most cogent. You can only select one of the available pieces of information.” Correspondingly, the instruction for the direction <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> focus was as follows: “Very important: half of the following articles are in favor of an extension and half of them are against an extension of Mr. Miller’s contract. Please bear this in mind as you select a piece of information; you should just consider whether you would like to read a piece of information that supports your prior decision or one that contradicts it. You can only select one of the available pieces of information.” 4 Participants in the control condition received no extra focus instruction, the only instruction to them was “You can only select one of the available pieces of information.” Following information selection, participants made a final decision, which marked the end of the experiment. All participants were debriefed, informed why it was not necessary to read the selected pieces of information, and given a cup of coffee and a chocolate bar as a token of our thanks for participation.</region>

Given no induction, the analysis revealed a significant interaction between the factors Information Quantity and Information Selection, 2 (1, N 52) 13.18, p .001, indicating that participants in the 2-information condition selected more inconsistent (69%) than consistent pieces of information (31%), 2 (1, N 26) 3.85, p .05, whereas participants in the 10-information condition selected significantly more consistent (81%) than inconsistent pieces of information (19%), 2 (1, N 26) 9.85, p .003. This replicates the basic effect of information quantity on information preference that has also been shown in the previous three experiments. As predicted, this basic pattern was weakened or eliminated when a specific selection criterion was induced. Given the quality focus, participants in both the 2-information (71% consistent- information selections) and the 10-information condition (78% consistent-information selections) selected significantly more consistent than inconsistent pieces of information, 2 (1, N 24) 4.17, p .04, and 2 (1, N 27) 8.33, p .01, for the 2- and 10-information conditions, respectively. No significant interaction emerged, 2 (1, N 51) 0.32, p .57. Given the direction focus, participants in both the 2-information condition (92% inconsistent-information selections) and the 10-information condition (59% inconsistent-information selections) selected more inconsistent than consistent pieces of information, as predicted. However, since this tendency was stronger and significant in the 2-information condition, 2 (1, N 25) 17.64, p .001, and weaker and nonsignificant in the 10-information condition, 2 (1, N 27) 0.93, p .33, an unpredicted significant interaction emerged in the direction-focus conditions, 2 (1, N 52) 7.42, p .01. The results of Study 4 support the idea that the contrasting information preferences in conditions with 2 versus more than 2 (e.g., 10) pieces of decision-relevant information are due to different selection criteria. Basically, the 2- versus 10-information effect was replicated again. However, if participants were reminded about information quality in both the 2- and 10- information conditions, they selected significantly more decision- consistent than decision-inconsistent pieces of information. In contrast, when participants were reminded about information direction, in the 2-information condition, they systematically selected more inconsistent than consistent information, and in the 10-information condition, they selected slightly (but not significantly) more inconsistent than consistent pieces of information. Please note that the normally strong preference for consistent information in the 10-information condition vanished when an information direction cue was given. In sum, if the salient selection criterion was manipulated and thereby held constant, the 2-information versus 10-information effect disappeared. Therefore, the results clearly support our selection-criteria explanation.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="218" page="11" column="1">The proposition that people systematically prefer information that supports their decisions, attitudes, and opinions is broadly accepted in social psychological research (Brannon, Tagler, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="204" class="deo:Reference">Eagly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="205" class="deo:Reference">Festinger, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="206" class="deo:Reference">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="207" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="208" class="deo:Reference">Jonas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33" id="209" class="deo:Reference">Lundgren &amp; Prislin, 1998</xref>). However, some influential studies have revealed a systematic preference for in-<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> consistent information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="211" class="deo:Reference">Freedman, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="212" class="deo:Reference">Freedman &amp; Sears, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="213" class="deo:Reference">Sears, 1965</xref>). To date, it has not been clear why these different studies yielded contradictory results. A series of four experiments ascertained that the crucial difference between studies that found a systematic preference for consistent information and those that found a systematic preference for inconsistent information was the available quantity of selectable information. When people were confronted with 2 pieces of information (1 consistent, 1 inconsistent) they predominantly selected the inconsistent information. Yet when confronted with more than 2 pieces of information, they systematically selected the consistent information more often than the inconsistent information (Studies 1 and 2). We excluded complexity differences (Study 2) and dissonance and threat processes (Study 3) as possible psychological mediators. Furthermore, we found clear empirical support for a selection-criteria explanation of the information-quantity effect (Studies 2– 4): Information search basically follows the minimum-effort principle and, therefore, decision makers try to choose the selection criterion that best differentiates between all the available pieces of information. If there are several selection criteria that fit this description, then decision makers choose the criterion that requires the least cognitive processing effort. In the 2-information condition, information direction completely distinguishes between both available pieces of information and requires less cognitive effort than assessing expected information quality. Therefore, decision makers’ information search is guided by information direction, and, thus, they select the inconsistent piece, which helps them to be or to appear self-critical (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="214" class="deo:Reference">Kunda, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35" id="215" class="deo:Reference">Pyszczynski &amp; Greenberg, 1987</xref>). However, given more than 1 consistent and 1 inconsistent piece of information, information direction no longer completely differentiates between all available pieces of information. Therefore, decision makers switch to the cognitively more demanding assessment of information quality as the crucial selection criterion, which, however, because of a general subjective quality advantage of consistent over inconsistent information, causes a systematic preference for consistent information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="216" class="deo:Reference">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>; Schulz- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="217" class="deo:Reference">Hardt et al., 2007</xref>). Our studies clearly support this selection- criteria-based account for the effect of information quantity on selective exposure.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="225" page="11" column="2">The present results have several theoretical and practical implications. First of all, they resolve a long-lasting debate about the question of whether people predominantly prefer consistent to inconsistent information. Research from Freedman and Sears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="220" class="deo:Reference">Freedman, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="221" class="deo:Reference">Freedman &amp; Sears, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="222" class="deo:Reference">Sears, 1965</xref>) sug- gested that, above all, people prefer inconsistent information, which subsequently led to a substantial reduction in the number of studies on selective exposure. Although more recent research has shown that this termination was not justified and that selective exposure to consistent information is indeed an existing psychological phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="223" class="deo:Reference">Frey, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="224" class="deo:Reference">Jonas et al., 2001</xref>; Schulz-Hardt</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="236" page="12" column="1">et al., 2000), to date it has been unclear why <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="229" class="deo:Reference">Freedman (1965)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="230" class="deo:Reference">Sears (1965)</xref> found a strong preference for inconsistent information. The present studies resolve these contradictory results by demonstrating that the opposing-information preference is due to the different quantities of information available in the Sears and Freedman studies (2 pieces of information) compared to recent studies on selective exposure (more than 2 pieces of information). Moreover, the present research broadened the scope of the evaluation-based explanation of selective exposure (Schulz-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="231" class="deo:Reference">Hardt et al., 2007</xref>): We found that subjective information quality drives information search only under conditions in which information quality indeed is the salient selection criterion in peoples’ minds. In contrast, when information direction is highly salient, decision makers increasingly prefer inconsistent information in their information search. Together these results show how important the consideration of specific context factors (such as different information quantities) and their triggering of different selection criteria can be for the prediction of the direction of information search (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="232" class="deo:Reference">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>). Another important theoretical implication of the present results is that they induce doubt about the classic dissonance theoretical explanation of selective exposure. In situations in which information direction was the crucial selection criterion (these are situations in which dissonance and dissonance-reduction processes could work in their pure forms), participants did not prefer the consistent information, and even revealed a strong preference for the inconsistent information. In short, under conditions of high salience of information direction, participants wanted to be or at least to appear to be self-critical information searchers, which is a pattern that does not easily fit the classical dissonance explanation. On a practical level, the present results have important implications for decreasing selective exposure to consistent information, which has often been shown to decrease decision quality and thus increase the probability of bad decision outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="233" class="deo:Reference">Janis, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="234" class="deo:Reference">Kray &amp; Galinsky, 2003</xref>). The present research revealed that a preference for inconsistent information could be induced by not only reducing the number of pieces of information to 1 piece that conflicts with and 1 piece that supports a prior decision (which is seldom the case in real-life decision making) but also by increasing the salience of information direction with an explicit instruction to base information selection on information direction. This could be a promising new debiasing technique as long as it can be demonstrated that this debiasing effect also exists when decision makers are allowed to freely select among the available pieces of information and are not restricted to selecting only 1 piece of information. Tasks with different quantities of decision-relevant information available after preliminary decisions reflect real-life situations and are thus of considerable practical relevance for decision makers. For example, information quantity and associated information selection can be restricted (a) when decision makers are under considerable time pressure (so that they can gather only a very small amount of the existing information), (b) when they have limited cognitive resources (e.g., when multitasking or in high stress situations), (c) when additional information is very expen- sive (e.g., when the amount of money or effort one has to invest for gathering additional information is extremely high), or (d) when a specific event occurs very seldom. The following example could illustrate this: If a physician preliminarily diagnoses a very rare<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> disease (e.g., Menkes disease––a hereditary copper-based meta- bolic disorder), she or he has little additional decision-relevant information available (e.g., personal experience with this disease, experiences of colleagues, scientific publications) to make the final diagnosis compared to when a very frequently occurring disease (e.g., asthma) is at stake. Moreover, in the context of this example, not only information quantity but also the amount of selectable information can be restricted. That is, if a general practitioner has a preliminary suspicion that a patient suffers from a specific disease, she or he will transfer the patient to a specialist to clarify the diagnosis. Normally, because of time and money restrictions, general practitioners do not transfer patients to several specialists but to only one. For some diseases, many specialists are available (e.g., orthopedic problems), whereas for other diseases there are very few specialists available (e.g., rare hereditary disorders). The general practitioner has to decide to which one of the many available orthopedists (akin to our 10-information condition) versus to which one of the few hereditary disorder specialists (akin to our 2-information condition) she or he will send the patient. In addition, the general practitioner has an idea whether the specialist normally supports her or his preliminary diagnoses or not and why (which reflects our experimental information-search paradigm when participants know whether the selected information will be consistent or inconsistent to their preliminary decision). Due to our findings, the general practitioner is expected to send the patient with orthopedic problems to the orthopedist who normally supports her preliminary diagnoses (comparable to the 10-information condition), whereas, in contrast, the general practitioner is expected to send the patient with the supposed rare hereditary disorder to a specialist who is expected to be more critical with the general practitioner’s preliminary diagnosis (comparable to the 2-information condition). In sum, these examples illustrate that the experimental paradigm employed in the present research has important implications for real-life decision making and information search.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="248" page="12" column="2">Some limitations of the current findings have to be taken into account. First, in contrast to Studies 1, 3, and 4, we did not find a significant preference for inconsistent over consistent information in the 2-information condition of Study 2. Although participants selected somewhat more inconsistent than consistent information in that condition, this tendency failed to reach significance. One possible reason for this somewhat unexpected finding could be that the decision case employed was more involving than the other decision cases. Student participants had to decide whether they were in favor of tuition fees or not. Since this topic is highly relevant for students, additional motivational (defense related) factors could have been at work. As a consequence, increased defensive tendencies might have led to a more frequent selection of consistent information in the 2-information condition of Study 2 compared to the 2-information conditions of the remaining three studies (which employed less involving decision scenarios). However, at the same time, it is also possible that some random variation reduced the effect to a level below statistical significance. As the preference for inconsistent information given 2 available pieces of information was significant in three out of four studies, and because in the second study the means were also in that <marker type="page" number="13"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> direction, we generally consider the differential effect of information quantity on information preference to be a rather robust one. Second, inducing a direction focus in the 10-information con- dition— either by removing information content or instructing participants to attend to the information direction (Studies 3 and 4)— did not cause a clear, significant preference for inconsistent information (although the typical preference for consistent information in that condition was no longer significant). Therefore, either the manipulation of the direction focus was not strong enough or an additional, unknown variable affected information preference, especially in the 10-information condition. Future research should address this point and attempt to determine whether the manipulation was too weak on the one hand or to identify the missing determinants of information preference on the other hand. Third, in order to prevent demand effects, we did not measure participants’ motivation to be or to appear to be an unbiased decision maker (illusion of objectivity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="242" class="deo:Reference">Kunda, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35" id="243" class="deo:Reference">Pyszczynski &amp; Greenberg, 1987</xref>), which was postulated to be associated with the increased selection rate of inconsistent information in the 2-information condition. Future research should try to measure peoples’ intention to appear unbiased without possible demand and test whether that motive mediates the effect of information direction on information preference. Fourth, besides quality and information direction, there might be other possible selection criteria for information search, such as uncertainty reduction. In the context of stereotype-related information search, Trope and colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="244" class="deo:Reference">Cameron &amp; Trope, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44" id="245" class="deo:Reference">Trope &amp; Liberman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45" id="246" class="deo:Reference">Trope &amp; Thompson, 1997</xref>) doc- umented that information search can be systematically affected by the desire to reduce uncertainty about attributes held by another person, which in turn can lead to the employment of asymmetric information search and biased strategies of questioning. Uncer- tainty reduction might have played a significant role in our studies as well. For example, when participants were exposed to 10 pieces of information, uncertainty about the validity of one’s own standpoint might have been stronger than when they were confronted with only 2 pieces of information. Although the results of Studies 3 and 4 revealed that the two selection criteria (information quality and information direction) directly change the way individuals search for new information, future research should address whether uncertainty-reduction processes might have additionally interacted with the selection criteria we suggest in the present research. Fifth and finally, a limitation of the present research is that it does not directly address the extent to which the exposure to pieces of information with more or less decision-inconsistent content represents a threat to a decision maker’s prior decision. For example, in the 10-information condition, participants were informed that there exist at least five facts that speak against their initial decision. Such knowledge might imply a threat to this decision and thus might lead decision makers to spontaneously bolster their standpoint (i.e., selection of decision-consistent information). In contrast, in the 2-information condition, the threat implied by a single piece of decision-inconsistent information seems to be min- imal, which allows decision makers to satisfy their need for knowledge and examine the argument that contradicts their prior decision. 6 Although this threat-based explanation is very similar to the dissonance explanation of the effect (which was ruled out in Study 3), future research should nevertheless more directly address this<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> alternative explanation by measuring to what extent decision makers differentially feel threatened by inconsistent information in the 2- versus 10-information condition.</region>
