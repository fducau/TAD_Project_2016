      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="5" confidence="possible">In this article, the authors explored the existence of across-notation automatic numerical processing using size comparison and same– different paradigms. Participants were Arabic speakers, who used 2 sets of numerical symbols—Arabic and Indian. They were presented with number pairs in the same notation (Arabic or Indian) or in different ones (Arabic and Indian). In the size comparison paradigm, 2 digits differing both numerically and physically were compared on the physical dimension. Nevertheless, there was evidence that participants automatically processed the irrelevant numerical dimension in different notation pairs. In the same– different paradigm, 2 digits were presented either in the same or in different notations. Participants had to indicate whether the 2 digits were physically the same. The results again showed evidence for the automatic processing of numerical magnitude for pairs in different notations. Findings of both experiments suggest that numbers in different notations are automatically translated into a common representation of magnitude, in line with M. McCloskey’s (1992) abstract representation model. Keywords: automaticity, numerical processing, numerical notations</abstract>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="14" page="1" column="1">Numerical information appears in different formats, such as Arabic digits (e.g., 34), words (e.g., thirty-four), and Roman numerals (e.g., IV). Yet there is evidence that when humans perform a numerical task, the effects of differences in notations are mini- mal. The comparative distance effect (CDE), that is, faster responses in a numerical comparison task the larger the intrapair numerical difference, was found for both digits and number words (Foltz, Poltrock, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="7" class="deo:Reference">Potts, 1984</xref>). Similarly, the priming distance effect reflected in faster parity decisions to a target preceded by a numerically close compared with a numerically far prime was found to be similar in size when the prime and target were in the same or in different notations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="8" class="deo:Reference">Reynvoet &amp; Brysbaert, 2004</xref>; Reynvoet, Brysbaert, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="9" class="deo:Reference">Fias, 2002</xref>; Reynvoet, Caessens, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="10" class="deo:Reference">Brysbaert, 2002</xref>). These findings are usually taken as indicating that numerical symbols are mentally represented by a common code that is notation independent. Yet the above results were mostly obtained when participants deliberately conducted numerical processing. Therefore, it could be argued that they reflect mainly the task requirement and not the features of internal mental representation. We believe that analyzing automatic processing provides a better way to learn about the nature of stored representations (Ganor-Stern, Tzelgov, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="11" class="deo:Reference">Ellenbogen, 2007</xref>). In particular, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="12" class="deo:Reference">Bargh (1992)</xref>, we refer to a process as automatic when it runs to completion without monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="13" class="deo:Reference">Tzelgov, 1997</xref>).

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="29" page="1" column="2">approach to automaticity postulates that to diagnose a process as automatic, it is necessary to show that it can take place when it is not part of the task requirement. There is ample evidence for an automatic access to the numerical magnitude of Arabic digits (see Tzelgov &amp; Ganor- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="18" class="deo:Reference">Stern, 2005</xref>, for a review). The main question in the present context is whether there is an automatic access to the numbers magnitudes when the numbers are presented in different notations. Different predictions can be drawn from the different models on the representation of numerical magnitude. McCloskey’s (1992) model postulates that numerical information in whatever original form is converted to an abstract internal representation of magnitude. Thus, on the basis of this model, there should be evidence for automaticity in both same- and different-notation pairs. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="19" class="deo:Reference">Noel and Seron (1993)</xref> have argued that each individual has a preferred code to which all numerals are initially transcoded. If one of the codes is preferred, the access to the numerical meaning via the nonpreferred code should be slower, leading to a weaker indication for automatic processing. As a result, there should be evidence for automatic processing mainly in the preferred code. Previous research addressing this issue mainly focusing on the processing of numbers in Arabic and verbal notations has yielded inconsistent results. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="20" class="deo:Reference">LeFevre, Bisanz, and Mrkonjic (1988)</xref>, participants were required to verify the presence of a probe number in a previously presented number pair. Items for which the probe was the sum of the initial pair were rejected more slowly than items for which the probe was unrelated, thus suggesting that the numbers’ sum was automatically retrieved. Important for the present context, the same effect was found when the prime numbers were in verbal or in Arabic notation. In contrast, the evidence for an automatic activation of numerical magnitude, as indicated by the spatial-numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect, was found to be weaker for number words compared with Arabic numbers (Dehaene, Bossini,<marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="25" class="deo:Reference">Giraux, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="26" class="deo:Reference">Fias, 2001</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="27" class="deo:Reference">Dehaene and Akhavein (1995)</xref> explored the same issue using a same– different task with number pairs presented in the same notation (verbal or Arabic) or in different ones (verbal and Arabic). In the numerical same– different task, where participants indicated whether the numbers had the same numerical value, “different” responses were faster for pairs with large compared with small intrapair numerical difference, indicating a CDE similar in magnitude for both same- and different-notation pairs. More rel- evant for the issue of automaticity was participants’ performance in the physical same– different task, where they indicated whether the numbers presented were physically identical. The CDE was found only for same-notation pairs and not for different-notation pairs, thus suggesting that numbers in different notations are not automatically translated into a common representation of magnitude, in contrast with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="28" class="deo:Reference">LeFevre et al.

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="35" page="2" column="1">The present study broadens the existing research in two ways. First, previous studies on the effects of notation on numerical processing looked mainly at Arabic compared with verbal notations. The main problem with such a comparison is that numerical information is very seldom presented in verbal notation. In the present study, we examine the processing of two systems of numerical notations. We take advantage of the fact that the Arabic language uses a unique set of numerical symbols, which are referred to as Indian numbers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="31" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref>). Israeli Arabs are first introduced to the Indian digits, and only in the middle of third grade are they introduced to the Arabic numerals. From then on they use the Arabic numbers exclusively for mathematics, whereas the Indian numerals continue to be used mainly in written Arabic materials (e.g., newspapers, books). Thus, the participants included in the present study are familiar with the Arabic as well as with the Indian symbols, although they are more experienced with the former (Ibrahim, Eviatar, &amp; Aharon-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="32" class="deo:Reference">Peretz, 2002</xref>). Second, in addition to the same– different task, we investigate the issue of across-notation automatic numerical processing using a widely known paradigm in automaticity research—the size comparison paradigm. The use of two experimental paradigms, the size comparison (Experiment 1) and the same– different task (Experiment 2), enhances the generality of our results. In both paradigms participants are directed to process physical aspects of the numbers. Of most interest is participants’ performance with different-notation pairs; evidence for an automatic numerical processing in these trials will support the idea of auto-<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> matic numerical translation to a common representation of magnitude. As mentioned earlier, on the basis of McCloskey’s (1992) model, we would predict that the indications for automaticity will be similar for same- and different-notation pairs. In contrast, on the basis of Noel and Seron’s (1993) model, if numerical information is first translated to a preferred code, then the evidence for automaticity should be weaker for number pairs in different notations compared with number pairs in the same preferred notation. In the present study, we assume that the Arabic notation is the preferred one, because of participants’ longer exposure to this notation. This assumption is supported by a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="34" class="deo:Reference">Ibrahim et al. (2002)</xref>, conducted on the same population, which found that the speed at which the participants serially connected randomly scattered numerals was faster with Arabic digits than with Indian digits and that it was faster for same-notation compared with different- notation numbers.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="43" page="2" column="2">In the size comparison paradigm, pairs of digits varying in physical and numerical magnitudes are presented on a computer screen. In the physical comparison task, participants are asked to choose the physically larger digit while ignoring numerical magnitude. Automaticity of processing of numerical magnitude is indicated by the size congruency effect (SiCE), which is indicated in poorer performance in the incongruent condition (when the physically larger digit is numerically smaller) than in the congruent condition (when the physically larger digit is also numerically larger; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="37" class="deo:Reference">Henik &amp; Tzelgov, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="38" class="deo:Reference">Pansky &amp; Algom, 1999</xref>; Tzelgov, Meyer, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="39" class="deo:Reference">Henik, 1992</xref>). The SiCE is viewed as indicating that the numerical magnitudes of the two presented digits were automatically processed and compared with each other. Some studies (e.g., Ganor-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="40" class="deo:Reference">Stern et al., 2007</xref>) found that the SiCE increased with larger intrapair numerical difference, thus suggesting also the activation of the whole number line (see Tzelgov &amp; Ganor-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="41" class="deo:Reference">Stern, 2005</xref>, for a discussion of this point). However, this interaction of the SiCE and numerical difference was not always obtained (e.g., Rubinsten, Henik, Berger, &amp; Shahar-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="42" class="deo:Reference">Shalev, 2002</xref>). In the present study, we look at the SiCE (i.e., the difference in performance between congruent and incongruent conditions) and at its interaction with numerical difference for both same- and different-notation pairs. Finally, participants also performed the numerical comparison task in which they had to select the numerically larger digit. The analysis of this task mainly focused on the CDE with same- and different-notation pairs.</region>

Twenty students of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel) or Achva Academic College (Israel) participated in the experiment. All of them were native speakers of Arabic, who studied in a Hebrew-speaking academic institute. They participated either for course credits or payment. Stimuli. The stimuli set was composed by all the possible 28 pairs created from two different numbers in the range of 1–9, excluding 5. There were thus eight numerical differences, ranging from 1– 8. Each number pair appeared in the following three <marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> notations: Arabic, Indian, and Mixed notations (including both Arabic–Indian pairs and Indian–Arabic pairs). Each of the pairs appeared twice, once with the larger number on the left side and the other with the smaller number on the left side, thus creating a block of 224 trials. Each number was about 15 mm high and 10 mm wide, and the distance between the centers of the digits was 6.5 mm. In the physical comparison task, the numbers presented were in one of two physical sizes: large (18 11 mm) and small (12 8 mm). Each number pair appeared four times: twice in the congruent condition (with the numerically larger number appearing in a physically larger size) and twice in the incongruent condition (with the numerically larger number appearing in a physically smaller size). In addition, within each congruency condition, each pair appeared once with the numerically larger number on the left side and once with the numerically smaller number on the left side, thus creating a block of 448 trials. Apparatus. The experiment was conducted on a Pentium IBM clone personal computer with a 14-in. [35.56-cm] monitor screen. The experiment was programmed in E-Prime software (Schneider, Eschman, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="48" class="deo:Reference">Zuccolotto, 2002</xref>) Procedure. The experiment was conducted individually. Each participant performed both the physical and the numerical comparison tasks. The order of tasks was counterbalanced across participants. There was a short rest break between the two tasks as well as after each sequence of 112 trials. The participant sat about 50 cm from the computer screen. The trial started with a fixation cross that appeared at the center of the screen for 500 ms. Then two numbers appeared, each was 3 cm apart from the screen center. In the numerical comparison task, participants were required to select the numerically larger digit. In the physical comparison task, they had to select the physically larger digit while ignoring numerical magnitudes. Participants responded by pressing either the “L” key for the right number or the “A” key for the left one. In both tasks, participants were<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> required to respond as fast as possible but to avoid errors.

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="61" page="3" column="2">In both experiments, the numerical and the physical tasks were analyzed separately. Responses to both tasks were analyzed in terms of response time (RT) and error rate (ER). Numerical comparison task. Means of RT of correct responses and of ER were submitted separately for two two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), with notation (Arabic, Indian, Mixed) and numerical difference (1– 8) as within-participants variables, and order of task as an across-participants variable. In each task, we excluded from the analyses trials with RT shorter than 200 ms or longer than 2,500 ms (1.1% of the trials). Numerical difference affected both RT, F(7, 126) 30.26, MSE 8,035, p .001, and ER, F(7, 126) 12.06, MSE 0.004, p .001. Planned contrasts revealed that RT, F(1, 18) 103.45, MSE 15,818, p .001, and ER, F(1, 18) 22.89, MSE 0.01, p .001, decreased linearly the larger the intrapair numerical difference, indicating a CDE (see Figures 2A and 2B). The CDE was modulated by notation as reflected in both RT, F(14, 252) 1.75, MSE 4,823, p .05, and ER, F(14, 252) 2.09, MSE 0.002, p .05, as the slope of the linear trend varied across notations. Physical comparison task. Means of RT of correct responses and of ER were submitted separately for two three-way ANOVAs with notation (Arabic, Indian, Mixed) and size congruency as within-participants variables, and order of task as an across- participants variable. As can be seen in Figures 3A and 3B, performance was poorer in incongruent compared with congruent trials in both RT, F(1, 18) 58.35, MSE 2,395, p .001, and ER, F(1, 18) 6.67, MSE 0.004, p .05, indicating a SiCE. RT and ER were also affected by notation as RT was longer, F(2, 36) 112.18, MSE 3,805, p .001, and ER was higher, F(2, <marker type="page" number="4"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> 36) 9.46, MSE 0.003, p .001, for numbers in the Indian notation. To verify that the SiCE was not a product of the Digits 1 and 9, which as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="59" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref> are highly similar in the Indian and the Arabic notations, we reran the same analyses excluding those digits. A SiCE was present in all notations, both in RT, F(1, 18) 36.88, MSE 3,615, p .001, and in ER, F(1, 18) 6.66, MSE 0.004, p .05, even when Digits 1 and 9 were excluded. In addition, to check that the SiCE was not a carry-over effect from the numerical comparison task, we looked at the participants that performed the physical comparison task first and found a significant SiCE in the RT, F(1, 9) 40.50, MSE 2,050, p .001, and ER of this group also, F(1, 9) 7.46, MSE 0.003, p .05. This finding, coupled with the fact that the interaction between the SiCE and order of task for the whole group was insignificant, enabled us to rule out the explanation of the SiCE as a carry-over effect. To check for a modulation of the SiCE by numerical difference, we ran a three-way ANOVA with notation, congruency, and numerical difference as within-participants variables. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="60" class="deo:Reference">Dehaene and Akhavein (1995)</xref>, we included in the analysis pairs with a small numerical difference (i.e., 1) versus pairs with a large numerical difference (6, 7, and 8). The analysis of RT revealed in addition to the SiCE, F(1, 18) 36.11, MSE 6,342, p .001, a significant triple interaction between notation, numerical difference, and congruency, F(2, 36) 10.85, MSE 4,245, p .001, indicating that the SiCE increased with large numerical difference only in Mixed notations, F(1, 18) 26.82, MSE 3,077, p .001. The analysis of ER revealed a significant SiCE, F(1, 18) 11.16, MSE 0.01, p .001, which increased with larger numerical difference, F(1, 18) 15.35, MSE 0.002, p .001.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="65" page="4" column="1">The presence of the CDE in the numerical comparison task with different-notation pairs suggests that participants translated the <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> numbers into a common representation of magnitude on the same number line. Results from the physical comparison task, showing a SiCE for both same- and different-notation pairs, indicate that such a translation was conducted automatically, even when no numerical processing was required by the task. Moreover, in some cases the SiCE increased with numerical difference, suggesting that it reflects, in addition to an automatic pairwise comparison of magnitudes, some activation of the number line also. Note that the SiCE was present even when the Numbers 1 and 9, which are similar in the Arabic and Indian notations, were excluded from the analysis. There was also a consistent pattern of poorer performance for Indian notation pairs in the physical comparison task that seems to be attributable to a somewhat smaller perceptual discriminability in the physical sizes of the Indian numbers and, as such, has no theoretical importance.</region>

As ac- knowledged by the authors, the absence of a CDE for the latter might be explained at least in part by the fact that an Arabic number and a number word are highly dissimilar perceptually, and this enabled participants to respond quickly to the task, leaving little opportunity for the irrelevant numerical value to affect performance. The use of two sets of numerical symbols in Experiment 2 was expected to make the physical same– different task harder and to enable exploring the presence of a CDE under less speeded conditions. It should be noted that the same– different and the comparisons tasks, although similar, each provide a unique piece of informa-<marker type="page" number="5"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> tion, as the latter provides information on the numbers cardinality, whereas the former provides information about the numbers ordi- nality.

In the numerical same– different task, to equalize the frequency of trials from each difference category, the pairs with the numerical difference of 0 were presented four times each, the pairs with the numerical difference of 1 were presented four times each, and the pairs with the large numerical difference were presented twice each, thus creating a block of 48 trials. Each number was about 13 mm high and 9 mm wide. The distance between the centers of the digits was 6.5 mm. Each number in each pair could be presented in either Arabic or Indian notation. There were thus three notations: Arabic, Indian, and Mixed notations (including both Arabic–Indian and Indian–Arabic pairs), creating an experimental set of 48 4 192 trials. Following Dehaene and Akhavein, to prevent participants from focusing exclusively on the Numbers 1, 2, 8, and 9, we added 72 distracting trials using the Digits 3–7. The distracting trials were not analyzed. Please note that the frequency of “same” responses in the numerical same– different task was 33% in the experimental set, but it was 48% in the whole set (including the fillers). In the physical same– different task, the four pairs with a numerical distance of 0 in both the Arabic and Indian notations appeared eight times because of a programming error instead of four times as in the numerical comparison task. Thus, the experimental set included 224 instead of 192 trials, with 29% being “same” responses. With the additional 106 filler trials, the frequency of “same” responses was 40%. In any case, the critical comparison was always within the “different” trials, thus making the difference in the percentage of “same” and “different” responses less important. Apparatus. The apparatus was identical to that of Experiment 1. Procedure. The experiment was conducted individually. Each participant performed both the numerical and the physical same– different tasks, with the order of tasks counterbalanced across<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> participants. The participant sat about 50 cm from the computer screen. The trial started with a fixation cross that appeared at the center of the screen for 500 ms. In the numerical same– different task, participants were instructed to decide whether the two numbers were the same in terms of their values, irrespective of notations. In the physical same– different task, participants were instructed to decide whether the two numbers were physically identical. In both tasks, they had to press the “A” key for a “same” response and the “L” key for a “different” response. A few examples of same-notation and different-notation pairs were presented following the instructions for each task along with the correct responses. Participants were required to respond as fast as possible but to avoid errors. There was a short rest break between the two tasks as well as after each sequence of 112 trials. For 16 participants, the numbers in both tasks were flashed for 200 ms, and for the rest, they remained on the screen until the participant’s response.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="88" page="5" column="2">Numerical same– different task. Means of RT of correct responses and of ER for “different” trials were submitted separately for two two-way ANOVAs, with notation (Arabic, Indian, Mixed) and numerical difference (small, large) as within-participants variables, and order of task (first vs. second) and exposure duration (200 ms vs. unlimited) as across-participants variables. Less than 0.1% of the trials were excluded from the RT analyses because of RT being shorter than 200 ms or longer than 2,500 ms. As can be seen in Figures 4A and 4B, performance was en- hanced in pairs with large compared with small intrapair numerical difference in both RT, F(1, 28) 26.69, MSE 5,845, p .001, and ER, F(1, 28) 8.69, MSE 0.001, p .01, revealing a CDE consistent with the one found in Experiment 1. In the analysis of ER, the CDE was present for Arabic and Mixed notations pairs but was absent for Indian notation pairs, F(2, 56) 4.09, MSE 0.002, p .05. Finally, responses were faster when the exposure duration was 200 ms compared with when it was unlimited, F(1, 28) 5.95, MSE 11,763, p .05. Physical same– different task. Two analyses were conducted on participants’ responses to “different” trials. The first was limited to different-notation trials, and it tested the prediction that processing the numbers’ numerical value should impair participants’ “different” responses to different-notation pairs with the same numerical values compared with those with different numerical values. This effect is referred to as the value interference effect. The results of an ANOVA with numerical difference (0, small, large) as a within-participants variable and exposure duration and task order as between-participants variables confirmed this prediction. Responses for pairs with numerical difference of 0 were slower, F(1, 28) 13.08, MSE 8,124, p .005, and less accurate, F(2, 56) 33.40, MSE 0.006, p .001, than those for pairs with a small or large numerical difference, indicating the presence of the value interference effect (see Figures 5A and 5B). To verify that this effect was not a product of the across-notation similarity of the Digits 1 and 9, we analyzed the different-notation pairs within the filler trials that included the Digits 3–7. Responses for pairs with numerical difference of 0 were again slower, F(1, 28) 12.23, MSE 4,581, p .005, than those for pairs with a small or large numerical difference (549 ms vs. 489 ms), demon- <marker type="page" number="6"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> strating the generality of the value interference effect. In addition, to rule out the idea that the value interference effect was a carry- over effect from the numerical same– different task, we analyzed the responses of the participants that performed the physical same– different task first and found a significant value interference effect in the RT, F(1, 14) 5.66, MSE 22,276, p .05, and ER of this group also, F(1, 14) 16.66, MSE 0.01, p .001. The second ANOVA looked for a CDE, with notation and numerical difference as within-participants variables, and order of task and exposure duration as across-participants variables. Responses were faster when exposure duration was limited than when<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> it was not, F(1, 28) 14.03, MSE 66,171, p .001. Performance was also faster when the physical task was conducted second rather than first, F(1, 28) 5.05, MSE 66,171, p .05. Importantly, there was no significant CDE. Finally, there were no significant effects in the analysis of ER (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5B" id="87" class="deo:Reference">Figure 5B</xref>).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="97" page="6" column="2">When the task required numerical matching, there was evidence for a translation of numbers presented in different notations into a common magnitude representation, as indicated by the CDE <marker type="page" number="7"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> present for different-notation pairs in measures of RT and ER. Essentially, identical results were obtained in Experiment 1 of the current study and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="94" class="deo:Reference">Dehaene and Akhavein (1995)</xref>. When the task required physical matching, participants were slower and made more errors in responding “different” for different-notation pairs with the same numerical values. This value interference effect suggests that participants processed the values of the numbers appearing in different notations, even when this was not required by the task. Interestingly, there was no evidence for a CDE. We believe that the presence of the value interference effect together with the SiCE in Experiment 1 suggest that automatic numerical processing was taking place in the physical task and that the absence of a CDE is attributable to the sensitivity of our measures. The value interference effect reflects a difference in performance between congruent (different numbers in different notations) and incongruent (same number in different notations) trials. In the latter, the numerical and physical dimensions activate contrasting responses, which impair performance, relative to the congruent trials where the two dimensions activate the same response and therefore facilitate performance. In contrast, the CDE reflects a difference between two congruent conditions and therefore no activation of contrasting responses occurs, causing the effect to be weaker and less reliable. In addition, it has been shown in recent works that the distance effect depends on task demands and is not a mandatory product of conducting a numerical task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="95" class="deo:Reference">Goldfarb &amp; Henik, 2007</xref>; Pinchas, Henik, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="96" class="deo:Reference">Tzelgov, 2007</xref>).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="105" page="7" column="1">The main question posed by the present study was whether people automatically translate numerical information presented in different notations into a common representation of magnitude. On the basis of participants’ responses to different–notation pairs in both the physical comparison and same– different tasks, we con- clude that the answer to this question is positive. The strongest evidence comes from the size comparison task (Experiment 1), showing a SiCE similar in magnitude for same- and different-notation pairs. In most cases, the SiCE increased with numerical difference, thus suggesting the activation of a number line. The results from the physical same– different task (Experiment 2) showed a similar pattern, as performance was poorer in trials in which numbers with the same numerical values appeared in different notations compared with different numbers in different-notation trials. Note that whereas the former provides evidence for the automatic activation of ordinal information, the latter provides information for the activation of cardinality. To- gether, they suggest that a complete representation of numerical magnitude is created from numbers in different notations when such a representation is not required by the task. Participants’ performance in tasks requiring numerical processing, showing a CDE in both same-notation and different-notation pairs in the numerical comparison task (Experiment 1) and in the same– different task (Experiment 2), is entirely consistent with the above conclusion and with the previous findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="99" class="deo:Reference">Dehaene and Akhavein (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="100" class="deo:Reference">Foltz et al. (1984)</xref>. The present results have implications for models of the representation of numerical information. As mentioned earlier, the preferred code model would predict stronger evidence for automa-<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> ticity in the Arabic than in the Indian notation, as participants are more skilled with this notation. This prediction is not born out by the current results, as there is no difference between performance in any of the tasks between Arabic and Indian notations. In contrast, the abstract representation model of McCloskey that postulates the existence of an abstract numerical representation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="102" class="deo:Reference">McCloskey, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="103" class="deo:Reference">McCloskey &amp; Macaruso, 1995</xref>) would predict no difference in the indications for automaticity between same- and different-notation pairs. The present results, showing similar indications for automatic processing in all notations, are clearly in line with this prediction and, therefore, provide support for this model. The current results can also be discussed in the context of the triple code model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="104" class="deo:Reference">Dehaene (1992)</xref>, arguing for the existence of an analogue representation of numerical magnitude together with auditory and visual codes, with task requirement as an important factor determining which representation will be used. To accom- modate for the present results, the model should be revised to have room for more than one visual code and should specify an automatic access to the analogue representation from all visual codes. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to look at the use of two sets of numerical notations, and specifically at the Indian notation. Such research opens up inter- esting issues for future investigation, such as bilingualism in numerical cognition and the effect of language characteristics on number processing.</region>

Manuscript reviewers are vital to the publications process. As a reviewer, you would gain valuable experience in publishing. The P&amp;C Board is particularly interested in encouraging members of underrepresented groups to participate more in this process. If you are interested in reviewing manuscripts, please write to the address below. Please note the following important points: • To be selected as a reviewer, you must have published articles in peer-reviewed journals. The experience of publishing provides a reviewer with the basis for preparing a thorough, objective review. • To be selected, it is critical to be a regular reader of the five to six empirical journals that are most central to the area or journal for which you would like to review. Current knowledge of recently published research provides a reviewer with the knowledge base to evaluate a new submission within the context of existing research. • To select the appropriate reviewers for each manuscript, the editor needs detailed information. Please include with your letter your vita. In the letter, please identify which APA journal(s) you are interested in, and describe your area of expertise. Be as specific as possible. For example, “social psychology” is not sufficient—you would need to specify “social cognition” or “attitude change” as well. • Reviewing a manuscript takes time (1– 4 hours per manuscript reviewed). If you are selected to review a manuscript, be prepared to invest the necessary time to evaluate the manuscript thoroughly.
