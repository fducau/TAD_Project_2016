      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="35" confidence="possible">The cognitive control of behavior is a socially successful way to steer individuals into efficacious specific behavior that is beneficial for themselves and their groups. Socially valued concepts can become linked to socially appropriate behaviors that are automatically elicited from a reminder of the concept or a goal linked to that concept (Bargh, Gollwitzer, Lee-Chai, Barndollar, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="33" class="deo:Reference">Trötschel, 2001</xref>). For example, people who are incidentally reminded of “success” enact competitive behaviors because these specific behaviors are tightly linked to the concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="34" class="deo:Reference">Bargh et al., 2001</xref>). In addition to these specific behavioral effects of cognitive concepts, evolutionary and motivational considerations suggest a different modality of cognitive control, one that regulates general action versus inaction independently of what specific behaviors unfold.</region>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="68">General action can be defined as motor and/or cognitive output and general inaction as the lack of action. Action and inaction are of course not dichotomous entities but rather two ends of a continuum of activity. Intense and/or frequent motor and cognitive processes constitute the action end, whereas non-REM sleep exemplifies the inaction end with neither motor output (e.g., leg movement) nor cognitive output (e.g., dreaming). Given this definition, the action end can include not only important, well-planned, effortful behaviors, such as acquiring knowledge, but also seemingly more senseless behaviors, such as doodling, as well as relatively effortless behavior, such as eating when food is present. In other words, general action encompasses motor and/or cognitive output and unifies a wide variety of behaviors that may be driven by different goals. Whereas acquiring knowledge and doodling during a lecture may be respectively driven by the goals to achieve a good grade versus to entertain oneself, respectively, both acquiring knowledge and doodling are identical from a general action perspective. <marker type="block"/> The regulation of general activity undoubtedly owes to biological–dispositional factors, such as metabolic levels (Lawrence, Thongprasert, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34" id="37" class="deo:Reference">Durnin, 1988</xref>), processing speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="38" class="deo:Reference">Anderson, 1992</xref>), or the genetic bases of bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="39" class="deo:Reference">Baum et al., 2008</xref>). There are also likely social factors. Somewhat surprisingly, however, social psychology has paid little attention to processes underlying general activity levels. Instead, social psychology has concentrated on predicting, changing, and priming specific motor or cognitive behaviors, such as increasing seatbelt use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="40" class="deo:Reference">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2005</xref>) or reducing prejudiced responses to other people (see Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991). As a result, there has been no theoretical exploration of the processes underlying action and inaction.<marker type="block"/> This article addresses the possibility of a goal-mediated regulation of activity level, with a disregard for the type of activity that is regulated. General action and inaction goals are goals with end states at the extremes of the continuum of activity level (either high or low motor and cognitive output). When set, these goals can trigger a search for available and subjectively relevant means to reach these end states of high or low activity. That is, just as with the satisfaction of more specific goals, the satisfaction of general goals should proceed through the identification of available and appropriate courses of action that can satisfy the goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="42" class="deo:Reference">Bargh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="43" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski et al., 2002</xref>; Moskowitz, Li, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40" id="44" class="deo:Reference">Kirk, 2004</xref>). Both action and inaction goals imply commitment of effort toward the desired end state and should operate like other goals (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51" id="45" class="deo:Reference">Wright &amp; Brehm, 1989</xref>).<marker type="block"/> Although general action and inaction goals are purported to operate in ways similar to more specific goals, this conceptualization goes beyond current knowledge about human behavior. For example, in the domain of individual differences, locomotion is defined as the tendency to engage in goal-directed behavior and movement and is supposed to be orthogonal to assessment (i.e., the tendency to analyze and think deeply about any situation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29" id="47" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>). Likewise, past research has shown that certain decisions involve brain pathways that are independent of the type of motor behavior that is executed (Heekeren, Marrett, Ruff,<marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="block"/> Bandettini, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="52" class="deo:Reference">Ungerleider, 2006</xref>). In this context, our model offers a way in which both motor and cognitive activity (e.g., locomotion and assessment) can obey the same principle. As another example, goals have been insightfully described as systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="53" class="deo:Reference">Bandura, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="54" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42" id="55" class="deo:Reference">Pervin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44" id="56" class="deo:Reference">Powers, 1973, 1978</xref>), but no theoretical or empirical work has been previously conducted on goals that influence activity level. General action and inaction goals may trigger behaviors typically construed as part of different systems (e.g., an achievement goal system from an affiliation goal system or a dietary goal system).<marker type="block"/> In this article, we primed participants with words related to general action (e.g., “go,” “active”) or inaction (e.g., “rest,” “stop”). The experimental situations were designed so that participants had to either choose between a discreet active choice (e.g., doodling or making a paper airplane) versus an inactive choice (i.e., putting one’s head down for rest) or could choose to display a continuous behavior indicative of motor or cognitive output (e.g., the number of consumed food items or the amount of knowledge resulting from reading a text). Given a single focal way of satisfying action or inaction goals, our model’s prediction was straightforward. Specifically, action priming should lead to choosing a more active task and should cause more motor or cognitive output (e.g., choice of doodling on a piece of paper vs. rest, more learning vs. less learning) than inaction priming would. Goal mediation was assessed in subsequent experiments by examining, for example, whether activities that should satisfy general action and inaction goals reduce the behavioral effects of these primes (Marsh, Hicks, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37" id="58" class="deo:Reference">Bink, 1998</xref>). This pattern should not emerge if participants are simply executing prime-consistent behavioral procedures but are not motivated by, and thus remain insensitive to, the outcomes of their choices.<marker type="block"/> Understanding the effects of general action and inaction goals is important for various theoretical and practical reasons. First, our hypothesis implies that people control engaging in behavior that leads to motor or cognitive output before they control the quality or type of output. The usual tenet is that people strive to perform useful or desirable activity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="60" class="deo:Reference">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>), not just activity. Second, an interesting aspect is that these goals allow for top-down influences on both trivial behaviors, such as doodling during a lecture, as well as learning the presented material. Whereas conscientious and impulsive behaviors are seen as antagonistic phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="61" class="deo:Reference">Barratt, 1985</xref>), we propose a mechanism that can produce both. Third, whereas inaction is normally seen as a failure to act (Roese, Hur, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47" id="62" class="deo:Reference">Pennington, 1999</xref>), our model suggests that inaction can be an end state that people pursue. Last, evidence that these goals exist may be important in the context of goal and behavior research. Action and inaction goals, for example, may increase the likelihood of pursuing other goals that are of interest to researchers (D. C. McClelland, Atkinson, Clark, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38" id="63" class="deo:Reference">Lowell, 1953</xref>) and fit well within the hierarchical view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="64" class="deo:Reference">Bandura, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="65" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42" id="66" class="deo:Reference">Pervin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44" id="67" class="deo:Reference">Powers, 1973, 1978</xref>).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="71" page="3" column="1">If general action and inaction goals are plausible, using general action and inaction words as primes should influence physical and mental activities of various kinds. Therefore, one way of demonstrating these goals’ existence is to show effects of general action and inaction words on diverse activities. This demonstration requires first presenting word primes and then allowing individuals to link their primed goals to the concrete behaviors that are central to the study. For example, individuals may be offered opportunities to either rest or perform a task. As the tasks map onto culturally defined means of action and inaction, the action prime may trigger high motor or cognitive output, whereas the inaction prime may trigger rest. That is, people who are primed with general action may choose an active task, whereas people primed with inaction may choose rest. By the same token, relative to general inaction</region>

In other words, motor and cognitive output may be greater when general action rather than general inaction concepts are primed.</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="86" page="4" column="1">Importantly, action and inaction goals should have goal properties, involving but going beyond mere concept activation. First, goals are outcome driven; they are about maximizing action or inaction. In many conditions, the behaviors that lead to the goal’s end state are likely to be as active or inactive as the end state is. For example, satisfying action goals may entail simply selecting more active behaviors (leading to more motor or cognitive output). Correspondingly, satisfying inaction goals may entail simply selecting more inactive behaviors. Nevertheless, other situations are possible. If indeed goals are at stake, behaviors should be selected to achieve an overall outcome regardless of the active or inactive quality of the intervening behaviors. As a result, a long active end state could be potentially achieved through an inactive mean and a long inactive end state could be potentially achieved through an active mean. For instance, one may rapidly solve a problem now in order to sleep for an extended time afterward or briefly sleep now in order to solve a problem for an extended time afterward. If the outcomes are motivating, action goals will trigger the search for the longest active outcome even if the means are inactive. Likewise, inaction goals may trigger a search for the longest inactive outcome even if the immediate means are active. In contrast, if what triggers activity/inactivity is simply a procedure rather than a goal, immediate concept-consistent behavior may emerge irrespective of the ultimate amount of activity. <marker type="block"/> Second, the behavioral effects of the goals on motor and cognitive output should be stronger before the goal is satisfied than they are after the goal is satisfied (Atkinson &amp; Birch, 1970; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="77" class="deo:Reference">Ferguson &amp; Bargh, 2004</xref>; Förster, Liberman, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="78" class="deo:Reference">Higgins, 2005</xref>; Kawada, Oettingen, Gollwitzer, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="79" class="deo:Reference">Bargh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="80" class="deo:Reference">Lewin, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37" id="81" class="deo:Reference">Marsh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52" id="82" class="deo:Reference">Zeigarnik, 1967</xref>). For example, action goals should yield more overall active behavior provided that no prior activity has satisfied the goal. Likewise, inaction goals should yield less overall active behavior provided that no prior inactive behavior has satisfied the goal. Following a satisfaction opportunity, however, these effects should decrease and may even reverse.<marker type="block"/> We suggest that action and inaction goals are likely to exist as a natural consequence of evolutionary pressures (for an analysis of evolutionary pressures on cognition, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43" id="84" class="deo:Reference">Pinkerton, 1997</xref>). Upon encountering new situations, for example, mere activity can introduce solutions and generate knowledge in ways that are not facilitated by specific forms of cognitive control (for a discussion of flexibility, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29" id="85" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>). Eventually, a useful activity may develop that reduces the need for generalized activity and allows for refocusing on specific behaviors. Further, when one specific course of action fails, there are advantages to taking a general approach to the problem (“I need to do something, but what?”). Many solutions derive from the ability to reconsider all possible motor and cognitive processes rather than insisting on specific behaviors that have led to failure in the past.</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="87" confidence="possible" page="4" column="1">General inaction goals may also offer advantages. To begin with, conserving energy is important for survival. As a result, successful adaptation to the environment may require a mechanism to conserve energy by allowing certain symbols or social stimuli to trigger cessation of activity. Furthermore, there may be positive influences of inaction on problem solving. For example, when all courses of action fail, awaiting environmental input may be the best solution. In this way, concepts linked to general inaction may prevent hopeless action while an appropriate behavior is identified. As another example, the absence of</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="101" page="5" column="1">The procedures used to prime goals in recent years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="95" class="deo:Reference">Bargh &amp; Chartrand, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="96" class="deo:Reference">Bargh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40" id="97" class="deo:Reference">Moskowitz et al., 2004</xref>) seemed ideal to study general action and inaction goals. As general action goals presumably influence a variety of behaviors, incidental exposure to the word “action” may stimulate high frequency of behaviors with motor and/or cognitive output. In contrast, incidental exposure to the word “inaction” may stimulate people to rest and to be less active, even when active behaviors are situationally required (e.g., as part of the experimental procedures). Correspondingly, the word “rest” may decrease behaviors yielding high motor or cognitive output across a variety of situations.<marker type="block"/> We used words like “action” and “go” versus “rest” and “stop” as part of word completion tasks, detection of stimuli presented on the screen tasks, or scrambled sentences tasks. In Experiments 1, 2, and 3, general action primes were hypothesized to yield processes conducive to more motor output to a greater extent than inaction primes were. In Experiment 1, previously primed participants were told that they would have a break during which they could choose to fold or doodle on a piece of paper or to close their eyes and rest. Based on our hypotheses of more motor output in response to action rather than inaction concepts, the action primes should elicit higher proportion of folding/doodling than the inaction primes should, whereas the inaction primes should elicit a higher proportion of rest than the action primes should. In Experiment 2, word primes of action or inaction were followed by an opportunity to eat grapes that were presented to the study participants. Given that eating is a process involving motor output (e.g., delivering hand to mouth and chewing), we hypothesized that action primes would yield more eating than inaction primes would. In Experiment 3, previously primed participants watched a video of a college student performing a series of daily activities, such as checking e-mail and having a drink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45" id="99" class="deo:Reference">Ratcliff et al., 2004</xref>). The participants’ task was to watch the video and to press the computer space bar to divide the video into as many units of meaningful behavior as they identified. The number of presses was expected to be higher after action primes than after inaction primes.<marker type="block"/> Experiments 4 and 5 were designed to demonstrate effects of the primes on two cognitive activities, with the expectations of more recall and problem solving in action-prime conditions rather than inaction-prime conditions. In Experiment 4, we used brief supra- liminal exposures (50 ms) to action versus inaction words and then asked participants to study a passage about evolutionary psychology. Correct recall of the material afterward was expected to be higher after action primes than after inaction primes. In Experiment 5, participants first received the primes and then received verbal and math problems to solve. Given higher cognitive output, we expected a higher number of correctly solved problems when the prime was action than when the prime was inaction.</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="102" confidence="possible" page="5" column="1">The last two experiments of our series were designed to validate the assumptions that goals may mediate the effects of general action and inaction words. In Experiment 6, participants first completed word fragments that included either action or inaction completions. Similar to the earlier experiments, half of the participants (control condition) chose to rest or work on an intellectual problem for 30 s. The other half (experimental condition) of the participants chose either 30 s of rest followed by 3 min of solving verbal or math problems or 30 s of problem-solving followed by 3 min of rest. The outcome variable was the dichotomous immediate choice, which should be prime consistent in the control condition but prime inconsistent in the experimental condition.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="106" page="6" column="1">In Experiment 7, we primed participants with action, control, or inaction words and then introduced an intermediate task that was either active or inactive. The task could be either doodling on/folding an available piece of paper or resting for 2 min. Following the intermediate task, participants read a text about vegetarianism and listed their thoughts about what they read. The number of listed thoughts was used as a measure of motor/cognitive activity and should be greater when action goals are operating. Thus, unsatisfied action goals should produce a greater number of thoughts than unsatisfied inaction goals would. Importantly, however, these effects should be attenuated or even reversed when the preceding task had the potential to satisfy the primed goals.</region>

For about half of these participants, several of the completed words related to action. For the other half, the words related to inaction. Next, participants were asked to clear their minds by choosing either to fold or doodle on a piece of paper (active task) or to simply relax (inactive task). We predicted that participants primed with action would be more likely to choose the active, whereas participants primed with rest would be more likely to choose the inactive behavior. Importantly, the primes should produce these patterns of behavior because they activate action and inaction concepts and possibly concept-related goals. Therefore, prior to this experiment, we obtained evidence about concept activation using a lexical decision task. In another pretest, measures of mood were included to rule out the possibility that the primes had effects on positive and negative feelings.</region>

Participants were randomly assigned to either an action-prime condition or an inaction-prime condition. The design was a two-cell between-subjects design. There were also two pretests performed on independent study samples.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="113" confidence="possible" page="6" column="1">Experimental Procedures: Participants were first told that they would complete several tasks within their experimental session. The first of these tasks ostensibly measured verbal ability and was designed to prime participants with an action or an inaction concept. After the priming, participants were given an actual choice between an active and inactive task. The choice was followed by several filler tasks.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="115" page="6" column="1">Action and inaction primes: In the beginning of this experiment, we explained that we needed to administer a quick measure of verbal ability. Participants were asked to complete 20 words, 8 of which connoted either “action” or “inaction.” Depending on random allocation, half of the participants received 8 incomplete rest-related words that could be completed as “still,” “pause,” “interrupt,” “calm,” “freeze,” “unable,” “stop,” and “paralyze,” whereas the other half received 8 action-related words that could be completed as “motivation,” “doing,” “behavior,” “engage,” “action,” “make,” “go,” and “active.” Most of these words had high associations with “action” and “rest” in the (empirically derived) Computerized Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (Kiss, Armstrong, Milroy, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="114" class="deo:Reference">Piper, 1973</xref>).

Specifically, participants read the following: We will now give you two minutes to clear your mind. During this time, you should either: 1) remain seated and close your eyes for two minutes. During this time you should try to calmly relax and clear your mind, give your brain a break, or 2) do something with the scrap piece of paper you see at your computer station for two minutes. During this time you can doodle on the paper, fold it, or even make something like a paper airplane. The order of presentation of the active and inactive options was counterbalanced. After making their choice, participants learned that the computer would automatically proceed to the next screen after the 2 min had elapsed. After the 2-min period, participants were asked, “Did you remain seated with your eyes closed or did you do something with the piece of paper?,” and they responded by checking the box for either the number 1 ( I sat with my eyes closed) or 2 (I did something with the paper). These responses were verified by observation on the part of a research assistant.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="123" page="7" column="1">Concept activation check: Following the word-completion manipulation, the first pretest ( N = 60) entailed a lexical decision task in which 10 action words shown in the priming task (e.g., “active,” “go,” “move,” and “behavior”), 10 action words not shown in the priming task (e.g., “run,” “jump,” “hit,” and “build”), 10 previously shown inaction words (e.g., “stop,” “calm,” “freeze,” and “relax”), and 10 not-previously-shown inaction words (e.g., “dormant,” “sleep,” “rest,” and “serene”) were presented along with corresponding sets of 10 filler words (e.g., “day,” “wall,” “sponge,” and “lemonade”). The fillers were matched in word frequency, word length, and number of syllables to their respective critical words. A total of 60 nonwords (e.g., “bitavior,” “mobe,” srod,” and “cilt”) were also included. <marker type="block"/> The lexical decision task consisted of 10 critical blocks with six words from each word category and six nonwords per block. Before the critical blocks, one block of practice trials was run containing six neutral words (e.g., “television,” “apple,” and “this”) and six nonwords. Half of the participants were instructed to press the “9” key on the keyboard if they thought the stimulus on the screen was a word. Correspondingly, they were instructed to push the “1” key on the keyboard if they thought that the stimulus was a nonword. For the other half of the participants, the correspondence of the keys and words/nonwords was switched. (Order did not make a difference.) The participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="135" page="8" column="1">Pretests of Effects of Word Primes: The pretests were conducted to verify that the primes produced corresponding concept activation without altering participants’ mood. Each test is described in turn. <marker type="block"/> Concept activation: We first analyzed the mean time to respond to action, inaction, and filler words as a function of primes using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). 1 These analyses indicated that action primes yielded faster responses than inaction primes did for all types of words (for action vs. inaction primes, respectively: action words, M = 562.74, SD = 62.74 vs. M = 623.81, SD = 144.15; action-word-corresponding fillers, M = 578.94, SD = 72.02 vs. M = 628.83, SD = 135.27; inaction words, M = 595.18, SD = 63.53 vs. M = 628.77, SD = 145.76; inaction-word-corresponding fillers, M = 594.38, SD = 67.64 vs. M = 652.26, SD = 157.13). Given these generalized effects of the primes on response speed, the proper comparisons entail corrected response times, which were obtained after subtracting either action or inaction words from their corresponding matched fillers. Positive numbers in each case indicate that the reaction times for the action or inaction targets were faster (i.e., more activation) than the ones for fillers were, a zero indicates no difference, and negative numbers suggest greater difficulty for targets than for fillers.<marker type="block"/> The corrected action versus the corrected inaction indexes were analyzed using an ANOVA with type-of-word index as a within-subjects factor and prime (action vs. inaction) as a between-subjects factor. As one might expect if the primes elicit opposing concepts, there was a significant interaction between type-of-word index and prime, F (1, 58) = 4.05, p = . 04. The direction of the index of activation of action words was higher in action-prime conditions than in inaction-prime conditions ( M = 16.20, SD = 36.40, and M = 5.02, SD = 47.76, respectively), p for contrast = .31. Correspondingly, the direction of the index of activation of inaction words was higher in inaction-prime conditions than in action-prime conditions ( M = 23.49, SD = 54.74, and M = −0.80, SD = 42.66, respectively), p for contrast = .06. The absolute effect sizes corresponding to each contrast did not differ significantly from each other and in combination reached the significance indicated by the interaction. These results suggest that action primes activated action concepts more than they did inaction concepts, whereas inaction primes activated inaction concepts more than they did action concepts.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="136" confidence="possible" page="8" column="1">Feelings: With respect to effects on feelings, mood was not affected by the manipulation. Specifically, participants felt similarly positive feelings in action and inaction conditions ( M = 8.18, SD = 1.88 vs. M = 7.66, SD = 2.85, respectively), F (1, 33) = 0.41, ns . Mood was also measured in several of the subsequent studies with similarly null results, which are not presented for the sake of brevity. In combination with the lexical decision task data, these null effects render confidence in the possibility of concept activation without associated differences in feeling valence. Effects on Active Versus Inactive Choices: The analysis of participants’ behavior in Experiment 1 was consistent with predictions. Participants who received the action prime were more likely to choose the active task (62%, N = 33) than they were the inactive task</region>

In contrast, participants who received the inaction prime were more likely to choose the inactive task (64%, N = 29) than they were the active task (36%, N = 16). According to a kappa statistic, the association between the action/inaction prime and the dichotomous behavioral measure was statistically significant, κ(1, 98) = .27, p = .008. <marker type="block"/> Discussion—The data from Experiment 1 supported the hypothesis that subtly manipulated general action and inaction concepts can yield choices with relatively more and less motor output without producing differences in affective feelings. This pattern is consistent with the possibility that action and inaction goals influence motor output. To gain further support for our hypothesis, a second experiment was conducted using a different paradigm that can also capture processes with overt motor output. This second study also included a check for suspicion to rule out experimental demand effects. Later studies validated the goal mediation interpretation of our findings.</region>

A two-cell (prime: action vs. inaction) between-subjects design was employed.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="149" page="9" column="1">Procedures and Dependent Measure: Participants in this study first completed a series of word strings similar to the ones in the first study. Next, participants were told that they would have an opportunity to sample grapes that have been kept fresh in a new type of plastic container. After that, the research assistant presented the participant with a Styrofoam bowl containing 15 red grapes. The dependent measure in this study was the number of grapes eaten, which was obtained by asking participants at the very end of the experiment, before the debriefing, “How many grapes are left in your bowl?” Research assistants also counted the number of grapes remaining at the end of the session to verify participants’ responses. Furthermore, at the end of the study, several questions probing for suspicion and experimental demand were included. Specifically, participants were asked (a) “what was the purpose of the experiment?,” (b) “do you think any tasks were related?,” (c) “do you think any earlier task affected your eating?,” and (d) “did you notice anything about the experiment that seemed strange?” Responses were coded for suspicion and awareness of the hypothesis.</region>

This predicted pattern was statistically significant, F (1, 36) = 8.18, p = .007, and consistent with the hypothesis that action and inaction goals affect motor output. Importantly, no participant manifested suspicion or guessed the study hypothesis, thus increasing confidence in the subtlety of our manipulation. Similar checks in subsequent studies also revealed no awareness of the experimental hypothesis. In sum, Experiment 2 confirmed our hypothesis that priming participants with action concepts would produce more motor eating behavior.

          <region class="unknown" id="157" page="10" column="1">Experiment 3, we expected that segmenting observed behavior would be contingent on the priming of action or inaction. Behavioral-segmentation output was measured by the number of times participants pressed the space bar on the computer keyboard while watching the videotaped behavior of another person. Specifically, participants were primed with action, inaction, or neutral words, and then watched and segmented a 3-min long video of a student performing some mundane behaviors in a dormitory.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="163" page="10" column="1">We predicted that participants initially primed with action concepts would produce more behavioral segments than would participants who received inaction concepts. A growing body of work within the person-perception literature has shown that more effortful cognitive processing of a person’s behavior yields greater number of produced segments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="158" class="deo:Reference">Handley &amp; Lassiter, 2002</xref>; Lassiter, Briggs, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="159" class="deo:Reference">Bowman, 1991</xref>; Lassiter, Geers, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32" id="160" class="deo:Reference">Apple, 2002</xref>; Lassiter, Stone, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33" id="161" class="deo:Reference">Rogers, 1988</xref>). Although behavioral segmentation can be considered a measure of both motor and cognitive output, space-bar pressing comprises a precise measure of motor behavior. The following two experiments, however, included cognitive performance as a direct measure of cognitive output.<marker type="block"/> The behavior of the control participants was expected to fall somewhere in between the action and inaction conditions. That is, the relative placement of the control should depend on the baseline level of activity of participants in a given study, and may vary with a number of factors (e.g., time of day, time of the semester, weather). Importantly, however, the control condition should be neither less active than the inaction-prime condition nor more active than the action-prime conditions. Otherwise, the primes could not be construed as eliciting behavior at the extremes of the activity continuum.</region>

However, Experiment 3 further included a control task containing eight word fragments that could be completed as words unrelated to either action or inaction (e.g., “pear”). After completing the priming task, participants were informed that they would watch a short silent video as part of a study on person perception. They were asked to identify any meaningful behavior in the video and received examples of meaningful behaviors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45" id="166" class="deo:Reference">Ratcliff et al., 2004</xref>). An example illustrated various ways to segment the behaviors enacted by an individual reading instructions to a participant. Specifically, the participant might identify many behaviors, such as the individual standing in front of the participant, reading instructions, talking out loud, making eye contact and other gestures, listening to the participant, and answering the participant’s questions. Or, the participant might identify fewer behaviors, such as noting that the individual is standing, reading out loud, and responding, or even only that the individual is communicating instructions. The instructions then stressed that the participants should identify whatever behaviors seemed natural and meaningful to them and that there was no right or wrong way of completing this</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="175" page="11" column="1">Participants then watched a 3-min video of a Caucasian male in his early 20s engaging in mundane activities, such as drinking a beer, working on his computer, and sifting through papers on his desk. The computer recorded the number of times each participant pressed the space bar while watching the video. This tally served as our dependent measure, with greater number of units indicating more output or active behavior. As mentioned before, this measure should detect motor pressing of the space bar, in addition to perhaps cognitive thought about the observed behaviors. <marker type="block"/> Results and Discussion: Three participants identified no meaningful behaviors from the video and 5 other participants segmented the behavior sequence at a rate of 3 standard deviations above the mean for this measure. Therefore, the data from these individuals were removed from the below analyses, even though this procedure did not significantly alter the results. The reported results are based on data from 178 participants.<marker type="block"/> The number of meaningful behaviors identified by participants was analyzed as a function of prime (action, control, or inaction) using an ANOVA. The means corresponding to this analysis indicate that action primes ( M = 35.85, SD = 24.98) led to identifying more behaviors than did either control ( M = 29.02, SD = 18.85) or inaction primes ( M = 26.67, SD = 15.99). Moreover, the mean of the control prime fell in between the action and inaction primes. This pattern of means was supported by a significant effect of the primes, F(2, 175) = 3.28, p = .04. In addition, participants primed with action identified significantly more behaviors than did either participants primed with inaction or participants in the control condition ( p for contrasts = .02 in each case). Finally, participants in the inaction and control conditions did not significantly differ in the number of identified behavioral units ( p for contrast = .48). In sum, the study confirmed that the effects of the primes mapped onto action and inaction rather than producing two different effects falling both above or both below the baseline level of activity. Although in this study the difference between control and inaction primes was nonsignificant, a later study produced a significant difference between control and inaction primes.<marker type="block"/> In conclusion, this study demonstrated that action (vs. inaction) primes yield a larger number of presses to segment observed behavior. Thus, these data lend further support to our argument that general action and inaction concepts can trigger various forms of activity. In addition, the study showed that the action primes produced states that were more active than the control condition did. Importantly, however, the inaction-prime condition did not differ significantly from the control condition. This finding may imply that the baseline level was fairly inactive to begin with but suggests the need for further data comparing inaction and control primes. Thus, we tackle this issue later in Experiment 6.</region>

Specifically, each of the primes was presented on the center of the screen for 50 ms following a string of “&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;” (presented 100 ms before the prime), which functioned as a fixation point, and then followed by “XXXXXX” (presented after the prime was on the screen for 50 ms). The participants’ task was to press the space bar on the keyboard as quickly as possible when “XXXXXX” appeared on the screen. When participants pressed the space bar, another priming sequence began. Two variants of this task were constructed, one to prime general action and the other to prime general inaction. The primes and fillers used in these tasks were the same as those used in Experiment 1. After the task was complete, all participants read “You did a good job, congratulations!” regardless of their actual reaction times. <marker type="block"/> Educational passage on evolutionary psychology: We used a 771-word passage extracted from an evolutionary psychology book. This passage described the history and development of human dominance hierarchies. The material was presented to participants sentence by sentence with a 15-s break between each. Participants were instructed to think about the passage while reading it quietly.<marker type="block"/> Dependent measures: A set of nine open-ended questions was used to assess participants’ recall of the material. Two independent raters coded each question in terms of correctness (interrater kappa &gt; .93). For example, the passage argued that modern humans, like other primate species, form stable dominance hierarchies that have been observed among preschool children, human adolescents, and adults in prison. Correspondingly, the first question asked, “What groups were observed to verify this?” The correct answer was “human preschool children, human adolescents, and adults in prison.” Answers that failed to mention any of the three groups were coded as 0 ( incorrect ) whereas answers that correctly identified at least one group were coded as 1 ( correct ). An overall index of correctness was computed by obtaining the proportion of correct responses out of nine questions. Higher numbers in this index indicated higher recall of the material.<marker type="block"/> Results and Discussion—The means of correctness were analyzed as a function of prime (inaction vs. action) using an ANOVA. As expected, recipients of action primes responded with more correct answers than did recipients of inaction primes ( M of proportions = 0.58, SD = 0.11 vs. M = 0.45, SD = 0.21, respectively), F (1, 35) = 5.55, p = . 03. Thus, this experiment verified that action and inaction primes influence levels of cognitive activities, extending the previous findings beyond effects on motor behavior. These effects are consistent with the possible activation of general action and inaction goals and were conceptually replicated in Experiment 5.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="200" page="13" column="1">Priming task: Action or inaction was primed using a scrambled-sentence task. Participants were told that the experimenters were pilot testing an instrument to assess how people form sentences. In this task, participants rearranged four of five words to make a coherent sentence. Participants were given 12 scrambled sentences, 8 of which contained action- related words (e.g., book, action , is, the, fictional) or inaction-related words (e.g., the, tells, inaction, watch, time). The other 4 sentences contained control fillers (e.g., shoes, feet, green, cover, your). Participants performed this task on the computer and had an unlimited amount of time to complete it. The primes were never part of the sentence to be unscrambled.</region>

An example of these problems follows (correct answer is italicized): COLOR: SPECTRUM: A. TONE: SCALE, B. SOUND: WAVES, C. VERSE: POEM, D. DIMENSION: SPACE, E. CELL: ORGANISM.</region>

Thus, this study confirmed that action and inaction primes produced, respectively, higher and lower levels of cognitive output, as might be expected from the activation of action and inaction goals.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="212" page="14" column="1">Overview—Experiments 1–5 established the presence of a general effect of general action and inaction primes along with concept activation, in the absence of differences in mood. Although these findings are consistent with a goal activation interpretation, they are in no way conclusive. For example, the effect could be due to direct motor/cognitive activation following the concept, as has been reported in various disciplines of psychology ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="209" class="deo:Reference">Bargh, 1990</xref>; Hauk, Johnsrude, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="210" class="deo:Reference">Pulvermuller, 2004</xref>). The two possibilities are of course not mutually exclusive, but it is important to determine whether goal mediation was implicated.<marker type="block"/> One defining characteristic of goals is directing people’s behavior toward a particular outcome. Suppose that the observed active behavior following action primes is motivated by the goal to be active. In this case, recipients of an action prime may be able to choose a course of action that gives them the best opportunity to be active even if this choice implies a delay in satisfaction. Likewise, recipients of an inaction prime may be able to choose a course of action that gives them the best opportunity to be inactive even if this choice implies a delay of this opportunity. For this purpose, in Experiment 6, participants in the experimental condition were given the choice of (a) solving a verbal or math problem for 30 s followed by 3 min of rest versus (b) resting for 30 s followed by 3 min of solving verbal and math problems. The choices of these participants were compared against the choices of participants in the control condition who, after the priming, were simply asked to choose between 30 s of rest and 30 s of problem solving. If participants who receive action primes are motivated to be as active as possible, participants in the experimental condition should choose 30 s of rest as a way of accessing 3 min of problem solving. Correspondingly, if participants who receive inaction primes are motivated to be as inactive as possible, they should choose 30 s of problem solving as a way of accessing 3 min of rest. Notably, these effects could not be explained by mere concept activation. Activating the concept could explain the consistent choices in the control condition but should also produce the same bias in experimental conditions. That is, if motor representations are activated without goals, their effects should be apparent on the choice immediately after the prime (e.g., 30 s of problem solving) rather than on the later behavior choice (e.g., 3 min of rest). 2</region>

In addition, we hypothesized that this effect would reverse if the initial problem solving or rest was construed as a means to attain longer times resting or problem solving, respectively. This interactive prediction was tested by means of a logistic regression with the choice of immediate behavior (1 = problem solving, 0 = rest) as the outcome variable and word prime (1 = action, −1 = inaction) and description of the task (1 = experimental, −1 = control) as predictors. The analysis yielded a significant interaction between prime and task description, Wald χ 2 (1, N = 102) = 7.73, p = .005, a significant effect of the prime, Wald χ 2 (1, N = 102) = 4.55, p = .03, and a nonsignificant effect of the task description, Wald χ 2 (1, N = 102) = 1.44, p = .23.

In contrast, in the experimental condition, participants were more likely to choose the initial active task when they were primed with inaction rather than with action, p for difference &lt; .006.<marker type="block"/> In conclusion, Experiment 6 provided evidence that the effects observed in Experiments 1–5 are due to the influence of general goals. Whereas control participants primed with action (vs. inaction) chose active immediate tasks, experimental participants primed with action (vs. inaction) chose to be inactive initially to participate in a longer subsequent active task. This reversed effect of the primes in experimental conditions can be plausibly explained by goal mediation. After all, goals do not produce behavior in a blind fashion but with direction</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="237" page="16" column="1">Overview—Like Experiment 6, Experiment 7 was designed to determine whether goals are implicated in the effects of the action and inaction primes obtained in Experiments 1–5. Participants were first primed with action, control, or inaction words and then engaged in a brief randomly assigned task that could be either active (doodling) or inactive (resting). After the task, participants read a text and wrote down their thoughts about it. A greater number of listed thoughts was taken as an indication of greater cognitive activity and should be greater when participants have an action goal rather than when they have an inaction goal. <marker type="block"/> The inclusion of the task was designed to test whether the effects of the primes are discontinued when people perform behaviors that can satisfy the goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="233" class="deo:Reference">Bargh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="234" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40" id="235" class="deo:Reference">Moskowitz et al., 2004</xref>). An action goal should be present when participants were primed with action and had no opportunity to be active, and an inaction goal should be activated when participants were primed with inaction and had no opportunity to be inactive. In contrast, if the effects of the primes are goal mediated, action and inaction primes followed by an immediate prime-consistent task should have a different effect. In particular, these satisfied action goals should yield less activity than would unsatisfied action goals, and satisfied inaction goals should yield more activity than would unsatisfied inaction goals. Whether satisfied goals return to baseline level of efforts (i.e., no different from control-prime conditions) is an empirical question. Satisfied action goals may either produce the same effort as control conditions, more effort than control conditions, or less effort than control conditions. All these possibilities would indicate that goal satisfaction decreased striving toward the desired outcome. Finding the same or more effort would indicate mere deactivation of the goal, whereas less effort would indicate the sort of rebound effect that is occasionally observed in studies of goal satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37" id="236" class="deo:Reference">Marsh et al., 1998</xref>).</region>

That is, action primes followed by an inactive task produced a greater number of thoughts about the text than did inaction primes followed by an active task ( M = 6.94, SD = 3.46 vs. M = 3.36, SD = 0.81, respectively; p for contrast = .001), and both differed significantly from the control conditions (for active task: M = 5.00, SD = 2.24; for inactive task: M = 4.17, SD = 2.04; p for contrasts = .02 in each case). This finding replicates the results from our prior experiments in which the goals presumably stimulated by the primes induced different levels of motor and cognitive output.<marker type="block"/> Experiment 7 also provided evidence concerning the role of satisfaction. With respect to satisfying inaction goals, inaction primes followed by active tasks yielded a smaller number of thoughts than did inaction primes followed by inactive tasks ( M = 3.36, SD = 0.81 vs. M = 6.50, SD = 2.80, respectively; p for contrast = .006). This mean difference implies that satisfying an inaction goal decreased its effect, resulting in higher levels of activity. A similar decrease of the effect of the primes was present for the satisfaction of action goals. Action primes followed by inactive tasks yielded a larger number of thoughts than did action primes followed by active tasks ( M = 6.94, SD = 3.46 vs. M = 4.58, SD = 2.76, respectively; p for contrast = .02). Again, then, the expected decrease in the influence of the action goal following satisfaction was verified.<marker type="block"/> It is also interesting to compare the outcomes of satisfied action goals with those of unsatisfied inaction goals and control primes, as well as those of satisfied inaction goals with those of unsatisfied action goals and control primes. Action primes followed by an active task (satisfied action goals: M = 4.58, SD = 2.76) still yielded a larger number of thoughts than did inaction primes followed by an active task ( M = 3.36, SD = 0.81, p for contrast = . 05) and than did control conditions ( p for contrast = .02). This difference suggests that participants in satisfied action goals were still more active than were those with unsatisfied inaction goals. In contrast, satisfying an inaction goal led to a similar level of activity as not satisfying an action goal ( M = 6.50, SD = 2.80 vs. M = 6.94, SD = 3.46, respectively; p for contrast = .72), and both of these conditions had higher means than the average of the control conditions did ( M = 4.58, SD = 2.76, p for contrast = .001). This latter finding<marker type="page" number="18"/><marker type="block"/> suggests that satisfying inaction goals produced effects similar to those of unsatisfied action goals.<marker type="block"/> Discussion—To summarize, we reasoned that the effect of action and inaction goals should decrease or cease if a satisfaction opportunity arises. Consistent with this possibility, action, control, and inaction primes had corresponding influences on the number of thoughts elicited during text reading when there could be no prior satisfaction of action or inaction goals. That is, unsatisfied action goals produced the highest number of thoughts, followed by control conditions and then by unsatisfied inaction goals. Critical to our analysis, however, the introduction of a prime-consistent task following the prime either reduced or eliminated the effects of the goals. This finding strongly supports the contention that the findings in Experiments 1–5 can be goal mediated.</region>

Specifically, we activated goals with words that were broadly associated with action and inaction. These general goals then influenced responses that had no specific connection with the words that primed the goals. Sometimes these responses were trivial and not particularly conscientious, such as when participants folded a piece of paper (Experiment 1). Other times, these behaviors were important and conscientious, such as when participants solved intellectual problems (Experiments 4 and 5).</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="285" page="18" column="1">In preparation for Experiment 1, we used a lexical decision task to examine corresponding concept activation and ruled out mood effects. Furthermore, the presence of goals as an underlying mechanism was examined by assessing two types of effects that cannot derive from mere conceptual priming. First, as goals drive behavior with a particular outcome in mind, individuals with action and inaction goals should choose options that allow them to be maximally or minimally active, even when the immediate behavioral means to this outcome is not. Specifically, participants were asked to choose between a brief activity followed by a longer inactivity or a brief inactivity followed by a longer activity. Findings indicated that participants primed with action chose the brief inactive period followed by the longer active behavior, whereas those primed with inaction chose the brief active period followed by the longer inactive behavior. Thus, although control participants who were asked to choose between two immediate behaviors chose behaviors that were consistent with the prime, in <marker type="page" number="19"/><marker type="block"/> the more complex choice situations, participants were sensitive to the overall outcome. This finding cannot be explained by the mere activation of a concept.<marker type="block"/> In addition, in line with past research on the cognitive and motivational properties of goals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="279" class="deo:Reference">Chartrand &amp; Bargh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="280" class="deo:Reference">Förster et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="281" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski et al., 2002</xref>), we found that the effects of priming action and inaction decreased when a goal-satisfying task was executed. Specifically, action and inaction primes produced, respectively, larger and smaller numbers of thoughts in response to a written text. However, the effect of action primes decreased when participants were asked to doodle before processing the written text, and the effect of inaction primes was reversed when participants were asked to rest before processing the text. This pattern may result from a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52" id="282" class="deo:Reference">Zeigarnik (1967)</xref> type of effect (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="283" class="deo:Reference">Förster et al., 2005</xref>). That is, rather than merely producing deactivation of goals, satisfaction of the inaction goal produced a clear push towards action.<marker type="block"/> The finding that the effects of both action and inaction primes are sensitive to both potential outcomes and satisfaction is important for reasons other than ruling out conceptual priming. At first sight, the effects of action/inaction priming might be construed as an influencing motivation, with action primes producing high motivation and inaction primes producing low motivation. If this hypothesis were plausible, one should observe goal mediation only for action-prime conditions, presumably the ones in which motivation would be strong. However, the results from Experiments 6 and 7 highlight that both action and inaction primes produced commitment of resources to achieve an end even when the ends differed. That is, both action and inaction goals entail comparable motivation, although the end state individuals are motivated to achieve varies.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="289" confidence="possible" page="19" column="1">Selecting Different Viable Behaviors to Satisfy Action and Inaction Goals—</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="292" page="19" column="1">Future research should address the effects of general action and inaction goals when people enact or consider enacting more than one specific behavior. For example, individuals may intend to both cook a meal and check their children’s homework, or to exercise, watch television, and eat. In this case, the selection of a specific means to goal satisfaction should depend on the perceived ease and desirability of each behavior ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="290" class="deo:Reference">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2005</xref>). Action goals may prompt selection of active behaviors but which active behavior to choose should depend on other factors (e.g., salience, desirability, and the operation and strength of additional goals).<marker type="block"/> Similar considerations arise with respect to well-learned, dominant behaviors as opposed to new behaviors. If only a new behavior is focal, action goals should facilitate learning that behavior. However, action (vs. inaction) goals may also facilitate the application of a previously learned routine when such routines are available. Importantly, dominant responses may emerge when impulsive individuals are primed with action, even when these responses are prone to error. Furthermore, by activating dominant responses, action (vs. inaction) goals may sometimes reduce learning of new procedures. In any event, the conditions under which action and inaction goals trigger stability and change in behavior deserve research attention in the future.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="293" confidence="possible" page="19" column="1">The effects of action and inaction goals on attitude change and personality expression may also be analyzed in the future. For example, various forms of processing related to</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="310" page="20" column="1">persuasive communications may be respectively enhanced and reduced by action and inaction goals. In addition, action and inaction goals may influence the expression of personality tendencies in a variety of contexts. For instance, activating a general action goal may increase promotion and prevention strategies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="297" class="deo:Reference">Higgins, 1997</xref>) among chronically high-promotion and high-prevention people. As another example, action goals may trigger different behavioral choices for high-locomotion and high-assessment individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29" id="298" class="deo:Reference">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>), such that locomotors may choose motor activities and assessors may choose cognitive activities. Similarly, chronic behavioral activation and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="299" class="deo:Reference">Carver &amp; White, 1994</xref>) and action/state orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="300" class="deo:Reference">Kuhl, 1985</xref>) may determine whether effective planning or rumination predominate in response to action goals.<marker type="block"/> Relations to Brain Responses—General action and inaction both depend on activation and inhibition at the neural level (J. L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="302" class="deo:Reference">McClelland &amp; Rumelhardt, 1986</xref>). Depending on what focal behavior is used to pursue an action goal, the goal may require inhibition, release of inhibition, or activation. One may need to inhibit perceptual functions for executive control processes to operate and release inhibition of motor behavior to satisfy general action goals by means of movement. By the same token, inaction may require inhibition of movement or activation of mental strategies (e.g., counting sheep) that promote inaction before a state of inaction is attained. In any case, the excitatory and inhibitory outcomes of action and inaction concepts may deserve attention in the future.<marker type="block"/> Action Versus Perception—One interesting aspect of Experiment 3 is that action and inaction primes may have modulated not only motor output but also perception of the videotaped behavior. For example, participants may have become more sensitive to the behaviors of the target person without any active attempt to segment these behaviors or indicate this segmentation by pressing the computer space bar. In the future, general action and perception could be primed to see if the same or different effects emerge. As perception and action are linked at the neurofunctional level (see Rizzolatti, Fogassi, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46" id="304" class="deo:Reference">Gallese, 2001</xref>), priming perception and action may both increase perception, mimicry, and adoption of the goals of others (for a review of these phenomena, see Dijksterhuis, Chartrand, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="305" class="deo:Reference">Aarts, 2007</xref>). Future research should examine these possibilities.<marker type="block"/> Achievement and Flexibility Priming—Establishing that general action and inaction goals can be activated in the laboratory raises the question of whether these goals have been activated in prior studies. For example, priming achievement and flexibility has demonstrated effects on a variety of tasks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="307" class="deo:Reference">Bargh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="308" class="deo:Reference">Hassin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35" id="309" class="deo:Reference">Levesque &amp; Pellitier, 2003</xref>), raising the possibility that more general action tendencies were involved. The extent to which general action goals are at stake in these situations could be established through future systematic research. For example, instead of using a single behavior as the outcome measure, the effects of achievement might be established as high engagement in achievement-relevant behaviors but low engagement in achievement-irrelevant behaviors. More generally, however, the prior effects of achievement and flexibility represent instances of general behavioral effects akin to the ones demonstrated in this article.</region>

These same manifestations may correlate negatively with favorable attitudes about and goals of general inaction. Correspondingly, depression may correlate negatively with favorable attitudes about and goals of general action but positively with favorable attitudes about and goals of general inaction. In the future, these associations could be examined across individuals, regions within countries, and regions around the globe.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="319" page="21" column="1">General action and inaction goals may also be linked to structural factors and long-standing beliefs in a community. As one example, the generation of excess capital in the Modern Era (in Europe: years 1453–1789) may have facilitated activities that were previously impossible. An increase in the sheer number of activities may have led to inferences that activity is desirable irrespective of the activity. As another example, Buddhist beliefs imply that life is inherently imperfect and that attempts to improve it backfire. As a result, these beliefs may stimulate general goals of inaction. If these hypotheses are plausible, across nations, a low gross national product and a Buddhist religion may result in more sleep, less illegal drug use, reduced caffeine consumption, and greater incidence of depression. Future archival analyses may examine these predictions.</region>
