      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="19" confidence="possible">Research Report Show Your Pride Evidence for a Discrete Emotion Expression Jessica L. Tracy and Richard W. Robins University of California, Davis ABSTRACT— Three experiments provide converging evidence that pride has a distinct, recognizable expression. Experiment 1 showed that judges can agree in identifying a posed expression as showing pride and can reliably distinguish pride expressions from expressions of related emotions such as happiness. Experiment 2 showed that judges can identify the pride expression when the task uses an open-ended response format that does not cue them with the label ‘‘pride.’’ Experiment 3 showed that the pride expression includes a small smile, with head tilted slightly back, visibly expanded posture, and arms raised above the head or hands on hips. Overall, these findings challenge the assumption that all positive emotions share the same expression, and suggest that pride may be added to the pantheon of basic emotions generally viewed as evolved responses.</region>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="24">Building on Darwin’s (1872) seminal work on the expression of emotions, contemporary researchers have argued that emotions evolved, in part, to communicate needs that facilitate survival and reproduction, and that, consequently, each emotion should have a unique signal reflecting its evolutionary origins. Supporting this per- spective, research has demonstrated that there is a universally recognized nonverbal expression for each of the so-called basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and possibly contempt and embarrassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="20" class="deo:Reference">Ekman, 1992</xref>). Happiness is the only pos- itively valenced emotion on this list, leading researchers to conclude that all positive emotions share the same expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="21" class="deo:Reference">Ekman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="22" class="deo:Reference">Fredrickson &amp; Branigan, 2001</xref>). Thus, evidence that pride has its own distinct expression would overturn this assumption and imply that pride may have evolved to serve a particular communicative function. Pride is an important emotion that plays a critical role in many domains of psychological functioning (Tracy &amp; Robins, in press). Feelings of pride reinforce prosocial behaviors such as achievement and caregiving. The loss of pride, in the form of humiliation or ego threats, can provoke aggression. The regulation of pride is in- trinsically linked to the regulation and maintenance of self-esteem. In fact, pride is the emotion (along with shame) that gives self-esteem its affective kick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="23" class="deo:Reference">Brown &amp; Marshall, 2001</xref>), and self-esteem in turn influences a wide range of intrapsychic and interpersonal processes.</region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="32">Specifically, feelings of pride may boost self-esteem and thereby alert an individual that his or her behavior (or self) is valued by others. The expression of pride may serve a complementary adaptive function, drawing attention to the individual and alerting the social group that he or she merits increased acceptance and status. Despite its theoretical importance, pride has received relatively little empirical attention. Yet, in 1872, Darwin wrote, ‘‘Of all the complex emotions, pride, perhaps, is the most plainly expressed . . . a proud man exhibits his sense of superiority over others by holding his head and body erect’’ (p. 263). A handful of studies have indirectly addressed this possibility by examining the nonverbal behaviors shown after success experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="27" class="deo:Reference">Belsky &amp; Domitrovich, 1997</xref>; Kasari, Sigman, Baumgartner, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="28" class="deo:Reference">Stipek, 1993</xref>; Lewis, Alessandri, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="29" class="deo:Reference">Sullivan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="30" class="deo:Reference">Stepper &amp; Strack, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="31" class="deo:Reference">Weisfeld &amp; Beresford, 1982</xref>). The findings from these studies point to some possible components of a pride expression, including an expanded posture, upward or spread- out positioning of the arms, positioning of the head up and tilted back, and a smile. However, none of these studies tested whether pride has a recognizable nonverbal expression. This was the goal of the present research.</region>

Happiness and surprise photos were almost never identified as pride (Ms 5 5% and 0%, respectively). These findings suggest that individuals can agree on a pride expression and can distinguish it from happiness and surprise expressions. 2 However, Experiment 1 used a forced-choice response format, which may have inflated agreement by constraining responses (Russell, 1994).

Each target posed eight pride expressions, crossing small versus large smile, head tilted slightly (151) versus farther back (301), and arms raised above the head versus hands on hips. Happiness, surprise, and contempt were posed using DFA instructions; however, bodily components were added for a second surprise expression and a second contempt expression. Specifically, in one version of the surprise expression, targets posed the facial muscle movements as specified by the DFA, and in the second version, they posed these same muscle movements but also raised their arms in front of them, with a slight bend at the elbows. Similarly, in one version of the contempt expression, targets posed the facial muscle movements as specified by the DFA, and in the second version, they posed the same muscle movements but also tilted their head slightly (about 151) back. Two photographs were taken of each pose—one from the waist up (upper body) and one from the shoulders up (head and shoulders)—so that we could test whether pride recognition requires a visibly expanded posture. Thus, 16 potential pride expressions were available from each target. Each judge viewed 2 of these expressions as posed by all targets, so that smile intensity and head tilt were manipulated between subjects, and arm position and visible posture were manipulated within subjects.</region>

Forty-one undergraduate students viewed photos of targets posing eight pride expressions, crossing smile (none, small), head tilt (none, slight), and arm position (raised, hands on hips). Judges also viewed photos of targets posing anger, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Consistent with our expectations, an ANOVA showed that pride identification was higher for expressions with (a) a small smile rather than no smile, F(1, 38)535.30, p &lt; .01; (b) slight rather than no head tilt, F(1, 38)5 68.00, p &lt; .01; and (c) arms raised rather than hands on hips, F(1, 38)522.42, p &lt; .01. The only expressions recognized as pride at greater-than-chance frequencies (with chance set at 33%) were the two prototypical expressions identified in Experiment 3 (small smile, slight head tilt, arms raised or hands on hips); this pattern was reflected in a three-way interaction of smile, head tilt, and arm position, F(1, 38) 5 16.07, p &lt; .01. 5 To test whether pride can be recognized from the face alone, we asked 85 undergraduate students to view cropped photos (showing only the face) of the two best pride expressions and all happiness, surprise, and contempt expressions from Experiment 3. Pride recognition was not greater than chance for any of the pride photos (M 5 24%; range 5 11–38%). In all cases, identification rates were significantly lower for the face-only pride photos than for the un- cropped upper-body photos, ps &lt; .01. This finding, combined with the null finding for neutral facial expressions (i.e., no smile, no head tilt) described in footnote 4, suggests that both the face and the body are necessary for recognition of a pride expression.</region>

These findings have several broad implications. First, pride can be added to the pantheon of emotions that have distinct, recognizable expressions. This finding challenges the assumption that all positive emotions share the same nonverbal expression. More generally, the identification of a distinct signal raises the possibility that pride is an evolved response. If the pride expression is a product of natural<marker type="page" number="5"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> selection, then it may have evolved to serve a particular communicative function, perhaps to convey an individual’s success to others and thereby promote social status. For example, the expanded posture associated with the expression may attract attention to the individual and create the impression of largeness (which conveys dominance), and the slight head tilt may allow the individual to gaze above the masses, conveying superiority. A second broad implication of the present research is that nonverbal expressions of emotion are not restricted to the face. The prototypical pride expression involves nonfacial components: Pride recognition was significantly reduced when the expression was restricted to the head and shoulders, and was not greater than chance when the expression was restricted to the face (see footnote 5). However, body posture alone cannot signal pride, as the expression could not be recognized without the presence of the associated facial components (see footnote 4). A third implication of the present findings is that they provide the basis for coding participants’ feelings of pride from their observed nonverbal behavior. In other words, researchers who expect pride emotional responses in their experiments can assess the occurrence of such responses by coding for the presence or absence of the components of the pride expression. A nonverbal coding scheme will facilitate research on the antecedents, outcomes, and functions of pride in a wide range of contexts. The present findings suggest several other directions for future research. First, studies are needed to better delineate the components of the expression, specifying the exact musculature and body movements involved. Second, studies are needed to determine whether individuals ex- periencing pride in naturalistic settings display nonverbal behaviors consistent with the posed expression documented in the present research. It seems likely that this will be the case, because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="97" class="deo:Reference">Ekman (1973)</xref> noted, it is unclear how judges could reach agreement on posed expressions if the poses do not represent expressions that occur spontaneously. Third, studies are needed to explore the universality of the pride expression. 6 For example, can judges from a culture with minimal access to Western visual media recognize the expression? If so, this would provide further support for the hypothesis that pride is a product of natural selection. Fourth, studies should examine the social outcomes of the pride expression (e.g., does the expression convey leadership abilities?). Such studies will shed light on the proximal functions of pride, which likely involve motivating prosocial behaviors, and on the more distal functions, which may involve communicating dominance and status. In general, we hope that by demonstrating that pride has a unique nonverbal expression, the present research will provide a foundation for future studies on this important emotion.</region>
