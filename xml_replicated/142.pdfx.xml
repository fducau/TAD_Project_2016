      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="5">ABSTRACT— What motivates individuals to regulate their emotions? One answer, which has been highlighted in emotion-regulation research, is that individuals are motivated by short-term hedonic goals (e.g., the motivation to feel pleasure). Another answer, however, is that individuals are motivated by instrumental goals (e.g., the motivation to perform certain behaviors). We suggest that both answers have merit. To demonstrate the role instrumental goals may play in emotion regulation, we pitted short-term hedonic motives and instrumental motives against each other, by testing whether individuals were motivated to experience a potentially useful, albeit unpleasant, emotion. We found that (a) individuals preferred activities that would increase their level of anger (but not their level of excitement) when they were anticipating confrontational, but not nonconfrontational, tasks and that (b) anger improved performance in a confrontational, but not a nonconfrontational, task. These findings support a functional view of emotion regulation, and demonstrate that in certain contexts, individuals may choose to experience emotions that are instrumental, despite short-term hedonic costs.</abstract>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="7" page="1" column="1">One prominent feature of emotions is their hedonic tone: Some emotions are pleasant, others are unpleasant. Because individuals prefer pleasure over pain (Freud, 1926/1959), they are generally motivated to increase pleasant and decrease unpleasant emotions. Emotions, however, are more than feelings. They have instrumental aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="6" class="deo:Reference">Frijda, 1986</xref>). This suggests another motive for regulating emotions, namely, to increase useful and decrease harmful emotions. The investigation reported in this article tested whether instrumental motives for regulating emotions can trump short-term hedonic motives. We pitted instrumental and hedonic motives</region>

      </section>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="20" page="1" column="2">Emotion regulation refers to individuals’ attempts to influence their emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="12" class="deo:Reference">Gross, 2002</xref>). It is generally assumed that individuals seek to increase pleasant and decrease unpleasant emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="13" class="deo:Reference">Larsen, 2000</xref>). Self-regulation, however, is not driven exclusively by short-term hedonic considerations. Indeed, individuals often forgo immediate pleasure to maximize long-term utility (Mischel, Shoda, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="14" class="deo:Reference">Rodriguez, 1989</xref>). Such instrumental motives might play a role in the regulation of emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="15" class="deo:Reference">Parrott, 1993</xref>). Therefore, we endorse an instrumental approach to emotion regulation, according to which preferences for emotions depend on the balance of their hedonic and instrumental benefits in a given context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="16" class="deo:Reference">Tamir, 2005</xref>; Tamir, Chiu, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="17" class="deo:Reference">Gross, 2007</xref>). The hedonic and instrumental benefits of emotions are sepa- rable. Both pleasant and unpleasant emotions can be useful in specific contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="18" class="deo:Reference">Izard, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="19" class="deo:Reference">Keltner &amp; Gross, 1999</xref>). Individuals may be motivated to increase pleasant emotions for either their short-term hedonic or their instrumental benefits. However, individuals may be motivated to increase unpleasant emotions primarily for their instrumental benefits. Empirical support for the idea that emotion regulation can be motivated by instrumental considerations is currently scarce. Therefore, this investigation examined whether individuals can be motivated to increase their experience of potentially useful, yet unpleasant, emotions. Specifically, we tested whether individuals would seek to increase their anger when they were expecting to engage in a task in which anger might be helpful.</region>

      </section>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="32" page="1" column="2">Anger is an unpleasant emotion. It arises when individuals feel they are not attaining a goal because of another person’s im- proper action, yet feel capable of altering the situation (Frijda, <marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> 1986). To promote the defense of one’s resources, anger increases aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="27" class="deo:Reference">Frijda, 1986</xref>), which propels one to confront others. Anger, therefore, promotes confrontational behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="28" class="deo:Reference">Parrott, 2001</xref>). Although anger often leads to harmful consequences, it is sometimes useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="29" class="deo:Reference">Averill, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="30" class="deo:Reference">Tiedens, 2001</xref>). The instrumental implications of anger depend on the context in which it is experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="31" class="deo:Reference">Bonanno, 2001</xref>). Anger may offer instrumental benefits when one pursues confrontational goals. However, anger is unlikely to offer instrumental benefits when one pursues nonconfrontational goals. Building on these assumptions, we considered two inter- related questions. First, might individuals be motivated to increase their anger when they are anticipating confrontational, but not nonconfrontational, tasks? Second, does anger carry instrumental implications for performance in confrontational versus nonconfrontational tasks? We expected individuals to try to increase their level of anger, despite its unpleasant nature, when they expected to perform a confrontational, but not a nonconfrontational, task. We believed that such a preference would be driven by instrumental considerations, as reflected in subsequent performance. We expected anger to improve performance in a confrontational, but not nonconfrontational, task.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="37" page="2" column="1">To test whether motives for emotion regulation depend on anticipated performance contexts, we examined the extent to which individuals preferred to engage in activities that are likely to induce certain emotions (Erber, Wegner, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="34" class="deo:Reference">Therriault, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="35" class="deo:Reference">Tamir, 2005</xref>). Because anger is unpleasant and arousing, we compared preferences for anger with preferences for excitement, which differs from anger in pleasantness, but is equivalent in arousal. Participants were told that before playing a computer game, they would engage in another activity. They were then given descriptions of games that differed in their confrontational nature. After reading each description, participants were given examples of activities they could perform before playing the game and rated the extent to which they would prefer to engage in each activity. To ensure that emotional preferences were motivated by the emotional tone of the activity rather than the activity itself, we asked all participants to rate their preferences for two distinct types of activities—namely, listening to music and recalling past events. We expected participants to have stronger preferences for all anger-inducing activities (relative to excitement-inducing activities) when they were considering confrontational, but not nonconfrontational, games. We also tested the effect of anger on game performance. Following an emotion induction (i.e., anger, excitement, or neutral), participants played a confrontational and a nonconfrontational computer game. As a control for individual differences in baseline performance, participants played each game before<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> and after the emotion induction. We expected participants in the anger condition to perform better than other participants in the confrontational, but not the nonconfrontational, game. Fur- thermore, we expected this performance pattern to be anger- specific (e.g., as indicated by increases in aggressive game play).</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="69" page="3" column="2">We predicted that participants would prefer anger-inducing activities more than exciting or neutral activities when they were expecting to play a confrontational game, but not a nonconfrontational game. Therefore, for each type of game, we averaged preferences for listening to music and for recalling events from memory. We then ran a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the Game Type (confrontational vs. nonconfrontational) Â Emotion (exciting, neutral, angry) Â Activity Type (music, memory) interaction (all factors manipulated within subjects). As expected, we found a significant Game Type Â Emotion interaction, F(2, 162) 5 192.89, p &lt; .001 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="61" class="deo:Reference">Fig. 1</xref>). Preferences for anger-inducing activities were higher than preferences for exciting and neutral activities when participants anticipated playing confrontational games. However, a reverse pattern was found when participants anticipated playing nonconfrontational games. The Game Type Â Emotion Â Activity<marker type="page" number="4"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> Type interaction was not significant, F &lt; 1.01. Thus, preferences for emotion-inducing activities depended on the emotional tone, rather than the type, of the activity. This was confirmed in t tests of simple effects, t(81)s &gt; 4.20, ps &lt; .05, p rep s &gt; .99. Thus, before completing a task in which anger could be useful, individuals sought to increase their anger by engaging in anger- inducing activities rather than pleasant or neutral ones. These preferences were reversed when individuals expected to perform a task in which anger was unlikely to be useful.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="73" page="4" column="1">Confirming that the music elicited the intended emotions during task performance, repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that participants found the angry music to be less pleasant than the neutral and exciting music (Ms 5 1.67, 3.09, and 3.16); it was also more anger inducing (Ms 5 2.63, 1.30, and 1.18), and less exciting (Ms 5 2.43, 2.63, and 3.44), t(81)s &lt; 2.7, ps &lt; .05, p rep s &gt; .96. Angry and exciting musical selections were more arousing than neutral selections (Ms 5 3.22, 3.56, and 2.41), t(81)s &gt; 3.98, ps &lt; .05, p rep s &gt; .99. We standardized total performance scores in each round within each game. Because preinduction performance and postinduction performance were significantly correlated (rs 5 .54 and .63, ps &lt; .05, in the confrontational and nonconfrontational games, respectively), we created residual performance scores by predicting postinduction performance from preinduction performance within each game and subtracting predicted from actual scores (Robinson, in press). Thus, we obtained a separate residual score for overall performance in each game. These scores were entered in a repeated measures ANOVA, in which game (confrontational vs. nonconfrontational) was a two- level within-subjects variable and music condition (anger, neu- <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> tral, excitement) was a between-subjects variable. 2 As expected, we found a significant Game Â Music Condition interaction, F(2, 79) 5 5.02, p &lt; .01 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" id="72" class="deo:Reference">Fig. 2</xref>). Tests of simple effects confirmed that participants in the anger condition performed significantly better in the confrontational game than did participants in the excitement condition, t(79) 5 2.47, p &lt; .05, p rep 5 .94. Subsequent analyses revealed that the impact of music condition was limited to number of kills, which was significantly higher in the anger condition than in the excitement condition, t(79) 5 2.30, p &lt; .05, p rep 5 .92. The number of deaths did not vary as a function of music condition, t(79)s &lt; 1.10. Contrary to performance in the confrontational game, performance in the nonconfrontational game did not vary as a function of music condition, t(79)s &lt; 1.74. Thus, participants chose to increase their anger before playing a confrontational game, and doing so improved their performance. The benefit to performance was anger-specific, as in- dexed by increased aggression.</region>

We further demonstrated that these emotional preferences are, in fact, associated with instrumental benefits in confrontational contexts. Angry participants performed better than excited participants in a confrontational task. This enhanced performance was specific to the confrontational task and to outcomes associated with increased aggression (i.e., kills, but not deaths). Together, these findings demonstrate that individuals can be motivated to experience even unpleasant emotions in the short term, if such emotions offer instrumental benefits. Our findings are consistent with a functional approach to emotion regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="85" class="deo:Reference">Tamir, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="86" class="deo:Reference">Tamir et al., 2007</xref>), according to which emotional preferences depend on the goals (e.g., feel good, perform well) individuals pursue in a given context. Our findings make important contributions to the limited empirical evidence regarding emotion-regulation motives. We demonstrated that individuals can be motivated to increase unpleasant emotions, rather than decrease pleasant emotions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="87" class="deo:Reference">Erber et al., 1996</xref>; Wood, Heimpel, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="88" class="deo:Reference">Michela, 2003</xref>) or maintain unpleasant emotions (e.g., Heimpel, Wood, Marshall, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="89" class="deo:Reference">Brown, 2002</xref>). We also showed that such preferences are linked to instrumental motives, rather than motives to neutralize feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="90" class="deo:Reference">Erber et al., 1996</xref>) or experience trait-consistent states (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="91" class="deo:Reference">Heimpel et al., 2002</xref>). In summary, we demonstrated that utility can sometimes trump pleasure in motivating emotion regulation. Unpleasant emotions are important predictors of mental health. It is not surprising, therefore, that emotion-regulation research has emphasized the importance of decreasing unpleasant emotions. Our findings, however, suggest that experi- encing some degree of negative emotions in specific contexts may be adaptive, if those emotions promote goal pursuits (Tamir &amp; Diener, in press). Anger may be instrumental in some contexts (e.g., when fighting over limited resources) and harmful in others (e.g., when cooperating and sharing limited resources). In this investigation, we created artificial contexts in which anger could be more or less instrumental. Given the uncertain ecological validity of these contexts, future research should test our hypotheses in the context of daily life (e.g., aggressive sports).</region>
