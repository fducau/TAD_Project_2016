      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="6" confidence="possible">The item-specific proportion congruent (ISPC) effect refers to the observation that the Stroop effect is larger for words that are presented mostly in congruent colors (e.g., BLUE presented 75% of the time in blue) and smaller for words that are presented mostly in a given incongruent color (e.g., YELLOW presented 75% of the time in orange). One account of the ISPC effect, the modulation hypothesis, is that participants modulate attention based on the identity of the word (i.e., participants allow the word to influence responding when it is presented mostly in its congruent color). Another account, the contingency hypothesis, is that participants use the word to predict the response that they will need to make (e.g., if the word is YELLOW, then the response is probably “orange”). Reanalyses of data from L. L. Jacoby, D. S. Lindsay, and S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="5" class="deo:Reference">Hessels (2003)</xref>, along with results from new experiments, are inconsistent with the modulation hypothesis but entirely consistent with the contingency hypothesis.

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="17" page="1" column="1">Research on contingency learning has deep roots in both the animal learning and cognitive psychology literatures (e.g., Rescorla &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="7" class="deo:Reference">Wagner, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="8" class="deo:Reference">Shanks, 2007</xref>). One popular domain for this approach in cognitive psychology is the Stroop paradigm. The standard Stroop effect refers to the well-replicated finding that participants take longer to identify the print color of an incongruent color word (e.g., the word GREEN printed in red; GREEN red ) relative to a congruent color word (RED red ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="9" class="deo:Reference">Stroop, 1935</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="10" class="deo:Reference">MacLeod, 1991</xref>, for a review). The magnitude of the Stroop effect changes when the proportion of congruent items is manipulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="11" class="deo:Reference">Lowe &amp; Mitterer, 1982</xref>). In particular, the magnitude of the Stroop effect increases as the proportion of congruent trials increases. The standard account of the influence of proportion congruent trials is that the detection of these proportions allows participants to modulate attention to the word, thereby changing the size of the Stroop effect (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="12" class="deo:Reference">Cheesman &amp; Merikle, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="13" class="deo:Reference">Lindsay &amp; Jacoby, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="14" class="deo:Reference">Lowe &amp; Mitterer, 1982</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="15" class="deo:Reference">Schmidt, Crump, Cheesman, and Besner (2007)</xref> have suggested that contingency learning provides a sufficient account of the proportion congruency effect.

Possible mechanisms by which participants use contingency information to control responding are considered, and one of them is tested. Both the response time and error data are consistent with this proposed mechanism.

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="36" page="1" column="2">A number of experiments ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="23" class="deo:Reference">Cheesman &amp; Merikle, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="24" class="deo:Reference">Lindsay &amp; Jacoby, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="25" class="deo:Reference">Lowe &amp; Mitterer, 1982</xref>) have shown that the magnitude of the Stroop effect can be modulated by varying the proportion of congruent trials. Specifically, the Stroop effect is larger when most of the trials in the experiment are congruent (high proportion congruent) than when most of the trials are incongruent (low proportion congruent). The standard explanation of this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="26" class="deo:Reference">Cheesman &amp; Merikle, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="27" class="deo:Reference">Lindsay &amp; Jacoby, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="28" class="deo:Reference">Lowe &amp; Mitterer, 1982</xref>), here termed the modulation hypothesis, is that participants strategically modulate attention to the word depending on the proportion of congruent items. For instance, when the word and color match most of the time (high proportion congruent), participants attend to the word more than usual. This will speed up responses on congruent trials (increased facilitation) and slow down responses on incongruent trials (increased interference), making for a larger Stroop effect. In contrast, when the word and the color mismatch most of the time (low proportion congruent), participants make a greater effort to ignore the word. This serves to decrease both facilitation from congruent words and interference from incongruent words, making for a smaller Stroop effect. Thus, the modulation account holds that participants use information about proportion congruency to drive<marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> the degree to which they will attend to the word, and thus to allow the word to impact performance in color identification. The modulation hypothesis seems to be the most widely accepted explanation for the proportion congruent effect. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="33" class="deo:Reference">Lowe and Mitterer (1982)</xref> concluded that their findings “demonstrate the strategic modulation of selective attention” (p. 698), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="34" class="deo:Reference">Lindsay and Jacoby (1994)</xref> stated that the effect “sug- gests that when most items are incongruent, subjects somehow inhibit the influence of word-reading processes, relative to when most items are congruent” (p. 225). Although intuitively appealing, the modulation hypothesis has difficulty explaining some findings. Given the assumption that participants modulate attention to the word, it would be expected that this modulation would be experiment-wide. That is, words should be ignored throughout a low proportion congruent block and attended to throughout a high proportion congruent block. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="35" class="deo:Reference">Jacoby et al. (2003)</xref> manipulated proportion congruency for each item (i.e., each color word) such that some words were presented most often in their congruent color (e.g., BLUE blue ) and other words were presented most often in a particular incongruent color (e.g., ORANGE yellow ). A proportion congruent effect was still observed, even though high and low proportion congruent stimuli were intermixed in the same block of trials. Jacoby et al. labeled this finding the item-specific proportion congruent (ISPC) effect. As Jacoby et al. point out, this finding is difficult to accommodate within the modulation hypothesis framework, because it would have to be assumed that participants are modulating attention to the word on a trial-by-trial basis depending on the identity of the word (e.g., if the word is BLUE, then the word is attended, but if the word is ORANGE, then the word is ignored). In essence, to defend the modulation account it would have to be maintained that participants decide whether to attend to the word after they have already read it.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="39" page="2" column="1">A different account of the ISPC effect, here termed the contingency hypothesis, is that participants implicitly learn contingencies (i.e., correlations) between words and responses and then use these contingencies to predict the specific response associated with each distracting word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="38" class="deo:Reference">Schmidt et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, if the word ORANGE is presented most often in yellow, then upon processing the word ORANGE participants will (unconsciously) predict that the correct response is “yellow.” This response prediction allows participants to shortcut some processing (thus speeding responding) when the predicted response is the correct one. When a word accurately predicts the correct response (e.g., BLUE blue , where BLUE is presented most often in blue), we call this a high contin-</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="51" page="2" column="2">gency trial. When the word predicts the wrong response (e.g., BLUE green ), we call this a low contingency trial. When the word does not predict a specific response (e.g., PINK brown , where PINK is presented equally often in all colors), we call this a medium contingency trial. We are not, of course, the first to point to a role for contingency in the Stroop task. Dishon-Berkovits and Algom (2000; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="42" class="deo:Reference">Melara &amp; Algom, 2003</xref>; Sabri, Melara, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="43" class="deo:Reference">Algom, 2001</xref>) have argued that when words and colors are correlated, participants will pick up on this cue, attend to the content of the word, and use that content to aid responding. For instance, in three experiments using a word–word version of the Stroop task, Dishon-Berkovits and Algom demonstrated that a Stroop effect is observed only when the correlation between words and colors is nonchance. According to these authors, when the correlation is chance, participants do not attend to the content of the distracting word. Although their account is not as specified as the current account (indeed, their argument could even be construed as a variant of the modulation hypothesis), their work is important because it highlights the importance of correlated events on responding. Although the modulation hypothesis has difficulty explaining the ISPC effect, the contingency hypothesis does not. According to the contingency hypothesis, in the high proportion congruent condition responses to congruent trials will be faster than usual, because participants can use the word to successfully predict the response (e.g., BLUE blue ; high contingency). The same advantage does not occur for incongruent trials in this condition because, for instance, BLUE does not accurately predict an incongruent “green” response (low contingency). Thus, by speeding congruent but not incongruent trials, the difference between incongruent and congruent trials (the Stroop effect) will be larger (i.e., relative to a condition where words are not predictive of responses). Similarly, in the low proportion congruent condition responses will be faster for incongruent items because participants can use the word to successfully predict the response (e.g., ORANGE yellow ; high contingency). The same advantage does not occur for congruent trials in this condition because, for instance, ORANGE predicts a “yel- low,” not an “orange,” response (low contingency). Thus, by speeding incongruent but not congruent trials, the overall Stroop effect will be smaller. According to the contingency hypothesis, then, proportion congruency manipulations are confounded with contingency. Specifically, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="44" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref>, in the high proportion congruent condition the magnitude of the Stroop effect is inflated due to confounding higher word-response contingencies for the congruent (.75) relative to incongruent (.25) items. Similarly, in the low proportion congruent condition the Stroop effect is reduced due to<marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> confounding higher word-response contingencies for the incongruent (.75) relative to congruent (.25) items. Fixing this confound is as simple as rearranging the cells in the design. Rather than comparing high contingency congruent trials with low contingency incongruent trials (the high proportion congruent condition), we can compare high contingency congruent trials (from the high proportion congruent condition) with high contingency incongruent trials (from the low proportion congruent condition). Similarly, rather than comparing low contingency congruent trials with high contingency incongruent trials (the low proportion congruent condition), we can compare low contingency congruent trials (from the low proportion congruent condition) with low contingency incongruent trials (from the high proportion congruent condition). After making this adjustment, the contingency hypothesis predicts a main effect of Stroop trial type (congruent, incongruent), a main effect of contingency (high, medium, low), and, more critically, no interaction between the two (given that we assume Stroop and contingency affect different processes). In contrast, the modulation hypothesis predicts an interaction because incongruent trials should be more affected by attention, given that the majority of the Stroop effect is interference, with little or no facilitation from congruent trials (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="50" class="deo:Reference">MacLeod, 1991</xref>, for a review).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="54" page="3" column="1">The contingency hypothesis claims that participants use response prediction to speed responses on high contingency trials. There are undoubtedly many mechanisms that could be proposed to explain how this occurs. For the purpose of this article, we test the a priori hypothesis that participants prepare for a response by simply lowering the threshold for the expected response and do not alter the threshold for any other. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="53" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref>, for instance, if the word ORANGE is presented most often in yellow, then presentation of the word ORANGE will lead the participant to reduce the threshold for a “yellow” response. Consequently, it will take less activation of this potential response for it to be made. This mechanism therefore predicts response time facilitation on high contingency trials (where the predicted response is correct) relative to medium contingency trials (where no prediction is made). However, no interference for response time is expected on low</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="58" page="3" column="2">contingency trials (where the predicted response is incorrect) relative to medium contingency trials, because on both low and medium contingency trials the response threshold for the correct response is maintained at the same level. For instance, if BLUE is presented most often in blue, then when participants are given the low contingency trial BLUE green they will see the word BLUE and expect a “blue” response. As such, the response threshold for the (incorrect) “blue” response will be lowered, but the threshold for the (correct) “green” response will not be changed. As a result, it will take just as long to make a correct “green” response as it would if no prediction were made. Critically, then, the contingency hypothesis predicts response facilitation, but not response interference for response times. It is important to emphasize the reason that this account does not predict interference on low contingency trials. On a low contingency trial (e.g., BLUE green ), the distracting word is predictive of a specific response (i.e., BLUE predicts a “blue” key response). Thus, the threshold for this predicted response will be lowered. However, the response threshold for the remaining colors (green, yellow, and orange) will be unaltered. Because the correct response (“green”) is not the predicted response (“blue”), correct response latencies will not be speeded.</region>

(2003)</xref> ISPC Stroop experiment to test predictions derived from the contingency hypothesis. Specifically, it is expected that the contingency effect and the Stroop effect reflect the action of distinct processes whose joint effects are additive on response time. Therefore (and contrary to the modulation account), there should be no interaction between Stroop trial type (congruent vs. incongruent) and contingency. That is, the size of the Stroop effect should be the same for words with .75 contingencies (i.e., high-proportion-congruent congruent words vs. low-proportion- congruent incongruent words) as it is for words with .25 contingencies (i.e., low-proportion-congruent congruent words vs. high- proportion-congruent incongruent words) or any other contingency. Both congruent and incongruent trials should be faster in the high contingency condition, but the difference between congruent and incongruent trials should not vary with contingency. In a final analysis, high contingency and low contingency trials are compared to medium (chance) contingency trials to assess, respectively, facilitation and interference. On the basis of the response prediction mechanism, the expectation is that the contingency effect will be solely facilitative for response latencies. In other words, although there is a benefit in responding to items where the words have greater than chance contingencies, there is no cost in responding to items where the words have lower than chance contingencies.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="82" page="4" column="2">The results of this reanalysis confirm the two hypotheses that follow from the version of the contingency hypothesis assumed here. First, the contingency effect and the Stroop effect (the difference between congruent and incongruent trials) act separately, in that these factors produce no interaction. Second, as predicted by the response threshold model, the contingency effect is entirely facilitative for response latencies. As discussed in the introduction, these findings provide further empirical support for this version of the contingency hypothesis, which holds that participants use distracter words to predict particular responses, thereby shortcutting some processing when this prediction is suc- cessful (high contingency trials) relative to when response prediction is unsuccessful (low contingency trials) or not attempted (medium contingency trials). These findings undermine the modulation hypothesis, which asserts that participants modulate attention to the word on the basis of the proportion congruency of the distracter words. Of particular importance, if it is assumed that participants increase attention to the word on high proportion congruent trials, then not only should congruent trials (high contingency) be speeded relative to the chance condition due to increased facilitation (observed), but incongruent trials (low contingency) should be slowed relative to the chance condition due to increased interference (which was not observed). Similarly, if participants suppress the word on low proportion congruent trials, then not only should incongruent trials (high contingency) be speeded relative to the chance condition due to decreased interference (observed), but congruent trials (low contingency) should be slowed relative to the chance condition due to decreased facilitation (which was not observed). Further, because interference is substantially larger than facilitation in the Stroop task, incongruent trials should have been more influenced by attention than congruent trials, resulting in an interaction between contingency and Stroop trial type (which was also not</region>

Thus, these data support the contingency hypothesis, but are in important ways inconsistent with the modulation hypothesis. Consistent with our findings, Logan, Zbrodoff, and Williamson (1984; Experiment 3) reported a null interaction between contingency and Stroop trial type for a four-choice Stroop task with a standard experiment-wide proportion congruent manipulation. In that experiment, the difference in response latencies between high and low contingency congruent trials was the same as the difference between high and low contingency incongruent trials. Logan et al. also reported a pair of two-choice experiments (Experiments 1 and 2) in which an interaction between contingency and Stroop trial type was observed. This could be regarded as a potential problem for the contingency hypothesis described here. However, it is important to note that experiment-wide proportion congruency manipulations (two-choice especially) are subject to confounding sequential effects (i.e., trial-to-trial modulations of word reading). For instance, if the word on the previous trial was congruent, then the Stroop effect will be larger on the current trial (probably due to increased attention to the word; Gratton, Coles, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="86" class="deo:Reference">Donchin, 1992</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="87" class="deo:Reference">Schmidt et al., 2007</xref>, for a similar finding regarding sequential contingency effects). Given that more trials are preceded by a congruent trial in a high proportion congruent block than in a low proportion congruent block, it would seem that simple proportion congruency experiments are ill suited to test the present hypotheses. 2 The ISPC paradigm used here, on the other hand, is able to rule out the sequential trial confounds, because each trial type is preceded by the same proportion of every type of trial (i.e., there are no systematic sequential confounds).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="92" page="5" column="1">The above reanalysis of the response latency data demonstrates that when the proportion of congruent items is manipulated, the resultant variations in the size of the Stroop effect can be explained by a confound between contingencies and proportion congruency condition. Specifically, in the high and low proportion congruency conditions, congruent and incongruent trials are not matched for contingencies (as explained in the introduction). In the current section, we expand on the contingency hypothesis used to generate the predictions for the first analysis and test some novel predictions that fall out of this account. In particular, whereas the response threshold mechanism described earlier predicts only facilitation in response latencies, it predicts both facilitation and interference in errors. The reason that facilitation is predicted on high contingency trials for errors is the same as that for response times: The threshold for the correct (predicted) response is lower. Consequently, it takes less time to make a correct response, and it is highly unlikely that participants will make another (incorrect) response because of the relatively lower threshold for the correct response compared to the incorrect responses. However, unlike for latencies, where no response interference was expected, response interference is predicted for errors because the threshold for one of the competing (incorrect) responses is lowered relative to the correct response and to the other incorrect responses. For instance, for the stimulus BLUE green (where BLUE is presented most often in blue), the threshold for the “blue” response is lowered. However, the “blue” response is not the correct response. Thus, there is an increased probability that par- <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> ticipants will make an error and select this predicted incorrect response (“blue”) over the unpredicted correct response (“green”).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="115" page="6" column="1">The contingency hypothesis presented here holds that participants implicitly learn contingencies and implicitly use them to aid responding. Further, we proposed a mechanism whereby participants use contingency information to reduce the response threshold for the predicted response. This account predicts facilitation with no corresponding interference when response latency is the dependent variable but both facilitation and interference when errors are the dependent variable. Both of these predictions were borne out. Further, contingency effects operate separately from the Stroop effect, a finding supported by the null interaction between contingency and Stroop trial type. To further test the contingency hypothesis, in Experiments 1 and 2 we investigate contingency effects in the contingency learning paradigm developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="108" class="deo:Reference">Schmidt et al. (2007)</xref> using color-unrelated words. It could be argued that the size of the Stroop effect is only incidentally equivalent in the high, medium, and low contingency conditions. It could also be claimed that the failure to find increased interference in the high proportion congruent condition and decreased facilitation in the low proportion congruent condition is merely a Type II error. But the modulation hypothesis rests on the critical assumption that the reason for variations in the size<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> of the Stroop effect is that participants detect the proportion of congruent items. The contingency hypothesis, on the other hand, makes no such claim. According to the contingency hypothesis, words and responses merely have to be correlated; color-related words are not necessary to observe contingency effects. In that vein, Schmidt et al. (2007; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="110" class="deo:Reference">Musen &amp; Squire, 1993</xref>) have reported several experiments that provide further support for the contingency hypothesis interpretation of the ISPC effect by showing that contingency effects can be observed in the absence of a Stroop effect. In their experiments, color-unrelated words (e.g., MOVE) were presented most often in a given color (e.g., MOVE 75% of the time in blue, SENT 75% of the time in green, etc.). Key press responses were faster to high contingency trials (e.g., MOVE blue ) than low contingency trials (e.g., MOVE green ). Thus, the results of these experiments confirm that participants are able to use words (even when they are color- unrelated) to predict what response to make. This is a critical result, because the modulation hypothesis cannot accommodate these findings given that the words and colors have no congruency relation that can be used to decide whether or not to attend to the word. Experiments 1 and 2 use the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="111" class="deo:Reference">Schmidt et al. (2007)</xref> paradigm to demonstrate contingency effects in the absence of any congruency relations. These experiments include a medium contingency condition (not used by Schmidt et al.) to demonstrate a facilitation- only pattern in the response latencies (Experiment 1) and facilitation and interference in errors (Experiment 2) to mirror the main effects observed in our reanalyses of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="112" class="deo:Reference">Jacoby et al.

Experiment 1 was a two-choice, rather than a four-choice, task (in part to ensure that the interactions observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="113" class="deo:Reference">Logan et al., 1984</xref>, were not attributable to something more than sequential confounds). In Experiment 1, several color-unrelated words were presented most often in a randomly assigned color. For instance, SEVEN might be presented 75% percent of the time in blue and 25% of the time in green. Other words, for instance CHAIR, were presented in blue and green equally often. This type of manipulation creates high contingency (.75; e.g., SEVEN blue ), medium contingency (.50; e.g., CHAIR blue ), and low contingency (.25; e.g., SEVEN green ) trials. Experiment 1 focuses primarily on response latencies, with the goal of replicating the facilitation-only pattern of results observed in Reanalysis 1. Experiment 2 uses the response deadline procedure used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="114" class="deo:Reference">Jacoby et al. (2003)</xref>, in which participants are given a very short amount of time to respond so as to maximize errors, and thus the analysis focuses on the error data. Experiment 2 attempts to replicate the findings observed in Reanalysis 2 and tests new predictions from the response threshold model. In both experiments, the responses are manual (i.e., key press) rather than verbal.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="133" page="7" column="2">Experiment 2 investigated whether the same pattern of facilitation and interference in errors observed in the ISPC task would be seen with a simple contingency task. In addition, Experiment 2 tested a novel prediction from the contingency hypothesis. The argument for the presence of response interference on low contingency trials for errors is that because the threshold for the (incorrect) predicted response is lowered, participants will be more likely to erroneously select this predicted response rather than the correct response for the color. For instance, for the stimulus MEET green , where MEET is presented most often in blue, participants will predict a blue key response based on the word. This will result in the threshold for the “blue” response being lowered and will therefore increase participants’ tendency to incorrectly make this response (i.e., because lowering a response threshold can be lik- ened to loosening the trigger for this response to fire). An observation of response interference in errors supports the notion of a response threshold mechanism, but this account further predicts that the inflation of errors in the low contingency condition is due solely to an increase in the specific predicted response rather than a general increase in errors. For instance, in a four-choice task, we should expect increased blue key errors for the stimulus MEET green , but no increased yellow or orange key errors. Although yellow and orange would also be incorrect responses, they are not the predicted incorrect response. Thus, it should be expected that more than a chance number of errors in the low contingency condition (33% of incorrect responses) should be the predicted response. Moreover, after correcting for this inflation of errors for the predicted response, we should no longer observe response interference.</region>

When Stroop effects are analyzed as a function of the predictability of the words (i.e., contingency), Stroop trial type (congruent, incongruent) does not interact with contingency in either response time or error data. This finding confirms the view that the entire ISPC effect (i.e., the highly replicated interaction between proportion congruency and Stroop trial type) can be accounted for by a main effect of Stroop trial type and a main effect of contingency.<marker type="page" number="9"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> Reanalysis 1 and Experiment 1 also demonstrated that contingency effects are solely facilitative in response times. That is, high contingency trials are speeded relative to medium (chance) contingency trials, but there is no disadvantage for low contingency trials relative to medium contingency. These results are inconsistent with the modulation hypothesis, but are entirely as predicted by the contingency hypothesis. According to the contingency hypothesis, response time facilitation occurs because participants are able to successfully predict the correct response based on the word on these trials and shortcut processing by reducing the response threshold for the predicted response. This same mechanism further predicts facilitation for high contingency trials and interference for low contingency trials in errors. These predicted results for errors were observed in Reanalysis 2 of Jacoby et al.’s (2003) data, as well as in Experiment 2. Error facilitation is predicted according to this account because the threshold for the correct response is lowered when it is predictable (i.e., on high contingency trials), and it is therefore less likely that participants will make any other response. Error interference is also predicted, because the response threshold for one of the incorrect responses is lowered when it is predictable (i.e., on low contingency trials), and it is therefore more likely that participants will make this particular error. Further analyses in Experiment 2 confirmed that the increase in errors in the low contingency condition is due solely to the increase in the specific predicted incorrect response.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="157" page="9" column="1">These findings have important implications for the conflict monitoring framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="154" class="deo:Reference">Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, and Cohen (2001)</xref>. Botvinick et al. propose that many of the effects observed in Stroop and Stroop-like paradigms can be explained by a conflict monitoring mechanism thought to lie in the anterior cingulate cortex. According to their account, the anterior cingulate cortex detects conflict when it occurs (e.g., when a word and display color indicate two different potential responses). After detecting conflict, attention is more stringently focused on the target. Through simulation work, Botvinick et al. have demonstrated that conflict monitoring can explain sequential Stroop effects (because attention to the target is increased following an incongruent trial) and the standard proportion congruent effect (because the greater number of incongruent trials in the low proportion congruent condition leads to more attention to the target dimension of color block-wide). Clearly, the conflict monitoring account of the proportion congruent effect is a variant of the modulation hypothesis and suffers from the same shortcomings. In particular, the modulation hypothesis is unable to explain the ISPC effect, because the amount of conflict experienced prior to high and low proportion congruent trials is the same (i.e., because they are mixed within the same block). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="155" class="deo:Reference">Blais, Robidoux, Risko, and Besner (2007)</xref> have presented a variant of the conflict monitoring account in which conflict is monitored separately for each item. For instance, each time YELLOW is presented as the distracter word, the level of conflict will be monitored. If YELLOW is presented most often in an incongruent color, then overall conflict will be high. As such, when YELLOW is again encountered, attention to the color will be highly focused, thus minimizing the impact of the word on performance. However, within the same block, BLUE may be pre-<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> sented most often in its congruent color, resulting in low overall conflict for this word. As such, when the word BLUE is presented, attention to the color will not be as focused, thus allowing the word to impact performance relatively more. Blais et al.’s variant of the conflict monitoring account can therefore explain the variations in the size of the Stroop effect when the proportion of congruent items is manipulated across items. But Blais et al.’s account simulates only the interaction between proportion congruency and Stroop trial type, and not the various other characteristics of the data (e.g., the fact that the effect is driven by the speeding of congruent trials in the high proportion congruent condition and incongruent trials in the low proportion congruent condition). More critically, their account cannot explain why contingency effects are still observed with color-unrelated words: There is simply no differential conflict to monitor between the various conditions. Another way the conflict monitoring model could be altered in an attempt to explain the ISPC effect is to turn learning back on and allow the system to learn contingencies by forming stimulus– response associations between words and colors. However, this change in the conflict monitoring model will still fail to simulate many of the results presented here. In particular, such a model would produce interference on low contingency trials in the response latencies, because the distracting word would activate an incorrect response (the “predicted” response), which would com- pete with the correct response. For that matter, we see no way for this version of the conflict monitoring hypothesis to return quali- tatively different results for response times and errors. In summary, although the conflict monitoring model of Botvinick et al. (2001) provides a compelling explanation for sequential Stroop effects (which undoubtedly contribute to the simple proportion congruent effect), the weight of the evidence to date suggests that the ISPC effect is better explained by contingency learning. Further, although sequential (Trial n 1) effects contribute to the simple proportion congruent effect, it is our suggestion that the remainder (and bulk) of the effect is explained by contingency.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="165" page="9" column="2">These results, successfully predicted by the contingency hypothesis, illuminate an error in the currently received conceptualization of proportion congruency manipulations. For instance, in the high proportion congruent condition of a two-choice task, congruent words with high contingencies (e.g., BLUE blue ) are being compared to incongruent words with low contingencies (e.g., BLUE green ). That is, words are 75% predictive of the correct response in the congruent condition, but only 25% predictive of the correct response in the incongruent condition. The reverse is true in the low proportion congruent condition, where congruent words with low contingencies (e.g., ORANGE orange ) are being compared to incongruent words with high contingencies (e.g., ORANGE yellow ). It is in this sense that Stroop effects (i.e., facilitation and interference resulting from conflict in meaning between related concepts) are confounded with contingency effects (i.e., prediction of responses based on word-response correlations). Given that the contingency hypothesis explanation of the proportion congruent effect appears sufficient, it would be prudent to question the “purity” of all Stroop effects emerging from method- <marker type="page" number="10"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> ologies with nonchance contingencies. Algom and colleagues have reached a similar conclusion (Dishon-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="162" class="deo:Reference">Berkovits &amp; Algom, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="163" class="deo:Reference">Melara &amp; Algom, 2003</xref>; Sabri, Melara, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="164" class="deo:Reference">Algom, 2001</xref>). The main methodological point is that, although nonchance contingencies may “maximize” the size of the Stroop effect (and thus its detect- ability), the said Stroop effect measure is confounded with contingency effects. Thus, any data collected with such a design may not be applicable to the standard effect with chance contingencies. For instance, in a four-color Stroop task, each word should be presented in each color 25% of the time (which is typically not the case). Any deviation from such contingencies will necessarily confound Stroop effects with contingency learning effects. This methodological point applies to all paradigms in which contingency information may aid responding.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="168" page="10" column="1">The results of two new analyses of work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="167" class="deo:Reference">Jacoby et al. (2003)</xref> along with the results of two new experiments disconfirm the generally accepted and intuitively appealing modulation hypothesis, which explains the proportion congruent effect in terms of control over attention allocated to processing the word. On the other hand, these analyses provide consistent support for the contingency hypothesis, which explains the proportion congruent effect in terms of the predictability of words (i.e., contingency). Specifically, the results are consistent with the proposed response mechanism in which participants decrease the threshold for the expected (high contingency) response. Of particular note, the contingency hypothesis successfully predicted differential results for response latencies and error rates. Confirmation of the contingency hypothesis will likely be associated with both frustration and excitement by researchers in cognitive psychology. The results may seem frustrating because they disconfirm the highly appealing modulation hypothesis and consequently bring into question the proper interpretation of the experiments that have made use of the paradigm over the last 25 years. On the other hand, these same results can be seen as exciting because they demonstrate the processing power, speed, and control of implicit processes.</region>
