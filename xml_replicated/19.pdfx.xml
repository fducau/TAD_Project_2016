      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="12" confidence="possible">How to Say No: Single- and Dual-Process Theories of Short-Term Recognition Tested on Negative Probes Klaus Oberauer University of Bristol Three experiments with short-term recognition tasks are reported. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants decided whether a probe matched a list item specified by its spatial location. Items presented at study in a different location (intrusion probes) had to be rejected. Serial position curves of positive, new, and intrusion probes over the probed location’s position were mostly parallel. Serial position curves of intrusion probes over their position of origin were again parallel to those of positive probes. Experiment 3 showed largely parallel serial position effects for positive probes and for intrusion probes plotted over positions in a relevant and an irrelevant list, respectively. The results support a dual-process theory in which recognition is based on familiarity and recollection, and recollection uses 2 retrieval routes, from context to item and from item to context. Keywords: recognition, working memory, serial position curves, recollection, familiarity</region>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="16">The purpose of the research reported on in this article was to test two families of theories of recognition, single-process (SP) theories and dual-process (DP) theories, and to help specify in more detail the process or processes that lead to recognition decisions. In this research, I focused on short-term recognition as tested with immediate memory tasks such as the Sternberg paradigm (Sternberg, 1969). In this paradigm, participants are presented with a short list of items that are followed by a recognition probe after a delay of a few seconds at best. Here I use two variants of that paradigm called local recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="13" class="deo:Reference">Oberauer, 2003</xref>) and the modified Sternberg task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="14" class="deo:Reference">Oberauer, 2001</xref>). In local recognition, each list item was presented in a different frame on the screen. Recognition probes were then presented in individual frames, and participants decided whether each probe matched the item presented before in the same frame. The recognition decision therefore was local to the frame in which the probe appeared—if the probe matched a list item in a different frame, it had to be rejected. In the modified Sternberg task, participants encoded two lists distinguished by their print color, and one of them was then declared as irrelevant. Recognition probes had to be compared with the relevant list, excluding the irrelevant list (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="15" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref>). These two experimental paradigms have two advantages. One is that they allow the researcher to separate item recognition from recognition of an item’s relation to its context. To this end I distinguished three kinds of probes. Positive probes were list items that should be accepted. In local recognition, these were the list items that reoccurred in their old frames, and in the modified</region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="22">Sternberg task, these were items from the relevant list. New probes were items that had not been presented in the current trial at all. Intrusion probes were list items that had been presented in the current trial but in the wrong context—in a different frame in local recognition, or as part of the irrelevant list in the modified Sternberg task. Although they matched an item of the set currently held in working memory, they had to be rejected because of a mismatch in the relation between item and context. Item recognition is the ability to distinguish between positive probes and new probes; relational recognition is the ability to distinguish between positive probes and intrusion probes. In the local recognition paradigm and the modified Sternberg task (Oberauer, 2003, 2005), as in many other recognition paradigms (Gronlund, Edwards, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="19" class="deo:Reference">Ohrt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="20" class="deo:Reference">Gronlund &amp; Ratcliff, 1989</xref>; McElree, Dolan, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="21" class="deo:Reference">Jacoby, 1999</xref>), relational recognition has proven to be harder than item recognition. This is reflected in intrusion costs: more false alarms are made to intrusion probes than to new probes, and correct rejections of intrusion probes are slower than those of new probes. The two theories investigated here address this fact in different ways. A second advantage of local recognition and of the modified Sternberg task is that accuracy and reaction times (RTs) can be analyzed by serial position in the list not only for positive probes but also for intrusion probes and, in the case of local recognition, even for new probes. In global recognition paradigms such as the traditional Sternberg task, negative (i.e., to be rejected) probes have no serial position because they bear no relation to any item on the list. In the local recognition task, however, new probes and intrusion probes can be analyzed by the serial position of the frame in which they are presented. For instance, let a list be A(1), B(2), C(3), with the letter representing the item and the digit in paren- theses representing its frame. The probe D(2) would then be a new probe in serial position 2. In the modified Sternberg task, intrusion probes have a serial position in the irrelevant list. In this article I show that the two theories investigated here differ in their predictions for serial position effects on negative probes.</region>

Their SP theory explains intrusion costs in experiments using negative probes closely similar to list items (e.g., the singular of a plural noun), and therefore it provides a potential explanation for intrusion costs in the two paradigms used here as well. The SP theory assumes that each item is represented as a conjunction of features, which I call an episode. Applied to the local recognition paradigm, the<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> item’s identity can be regarded as one such feature, and its context (i.e., the frame in which it was presented) as another feature. The same holds for the modified Sternberg task, in which the color of each item can be regarded as a context feature. Recognition decisions are based on a global match value, which is computed as the summed similarity between the probe and all list episodes, weighted by a term for the memory strength of each episode that depends on its serial position:</region>

To compute predictions for accuracy and RTs, I used a simplified version of the diffusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="40" class="deo:Reference">Ratcliff, 1978</xref>; Wagenmakers, van der Maas, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="41" class="deo:Reference">Grasman, 2007</xref>).

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="53" page="4" column="1">DP theories assume that recognition decisions are based on two sources of information: familiarity and recollection (Atkinson, Herrmann, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="44" class="deo:Reference">Wescourt, 1974</xref>; Diana, Reder, Arndt, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="45" class="deo:Reference">Park, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="46" class="deo:Reference">Mandler, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="47" class="deo:Reference">Yonelinas, 2002</xref>). The terms familiarity and recollection are often used to describe subjective experiences associated with a recognition decision—familiarity referring to a feeling of knowing the probe stimulus, and recollection referring to a memory of the episode when one has previously encountered that stimulus. Here I instead use these terms to refer to hypothetical mechanisms involved in generating recognition decisions, without making assumptions about accompanying subjective states or metamemorial judgments. Familiarity is a unidimensional quantity that is automatically assessed for each stimulus and that reflects the degree to which the same or a similar stimulus has been encountered recently. Recollection is the retrieval of an episode in which the present stimulus, or a similar one, has been encountered before. Whereas familiarity reflects memory only for the stimulus itself, recollection reflects memory for the stimulus in a specific context that defines the retrieved episode. Applied to the local recognition task and the modified Sternberg task, familiarity reflects the degree to which the probe matches one or several items represented in working memory: All probes matching a list item of the current trial can be assumed to be highly familiar, regardless of their context. For example, in the local recognition task, probes matching an item in the probed frame and probes matching an item in another frame are equally familiar. Recollection provides information about the context of a recently encountered probe—for example, in which frame it was seen. Familiarity is sufficient for item recognition (i.e., for distinguishing between positive probes and new probes), but recollection is necessary for relational recognition (i.e., for distinguishing between positive probes and intrusion probes). Intrusion probes are more difficult to reject than new probes, according to DP theories, because in response to an intrusion probe, familiarity and recollection drive the decision tendency in opposite directions, whereas with new and with positive probes they cooperate toward the same response. Familiarity could be assumed to vary with serial position—for example, the strength of an item’s representation might decay over<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="49" class="deo:Reference">Anderson &amp; Lebiere, 1998</xref>), or the items at the beginning of a list might be encoded more strongly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="50" class="deo:Reference">Farrell &amp; Lewandowsky, 2002</xref>), but for simplicity I assume that familiarity has a constant value of 1 for all probes matching any list item (i.e., for all positive and intrusion probes), and 0 for all new probes. All serial-position effects therefore are assumed to arise from the recollection process. Recollection can use two directions of retrieval. Recollection 1 functions by using the relevant context as a retrieval cue to recall the item or items associated to it. The recalled item or items are then compared with the probe. In the local recognition task, the relevant context is the probed frame, and recollection retrieves the item that has been presented in that frame. In the modified Sternberg task, the relevant context is a representation of the relevant list, and recollection is an attempt to recall all relevant list items. This process is modeled after theories of serial recall in which a representation of the list position to be recalled acts as a cue for the associated item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="51" class="deo:Reference">Burgess &amp; Hitch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="52" class="deo:Reference">Henson, 1998</xref>). Recollection 2 is the reverse process. The probe itself is used as a cue to retrieve the context to which it has been associated in the current trial, if it has been presented in that trial at all. If the retrieved context is not the relevant context, or if no context can be retrieved at all, the probe is rejected. For example, in the local recognition task, recollection would consist of retrieving the frame in which the probed item has been presented, and if that frame is not the frame that is presently probed, the item is rejected. Recollection 2 is inspired by the recognition model of Sikstr  ̈m (2004), which is a SP model in which recognition decisions rely in part on the degree to which a list context can be retrieved from the probe as cue. To formalize Recollection 1 , I assume that the probe is compared with each element of the set I of all items retrieved from the relevant context. The process returns a value of M 1 whenever the probe matches one item in that set, and of M 1 otherwise. This value is weighted by the strength S I of the item or items that determine the outcome—in the case of a match, S I equals the strength of the matching item, and in case of no match, S I equals the average strength of all items in I:</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="55" page="4" column="2">Recollection 2 is formalized in a similar way. The context retrieved using the probe as a cue is compared to the set C of all relevant contexts (i.e., the probed frame in local recognition, and the set of all serial positions of the relevant list in the modified Sternberg task). In case of a match, M 1, and in case of no match, M 1. If a context of origin can be retrieved for the probe, the strength term equals the strength of that context. If no context of origin can be retrieved, Recollection 2 returns M 1 with strength S C 1:</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="65" confidence="possible" page="5" column="1">Predictions for Serial Position Curves in Local Recognition</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="68" page="5" column="1">Experiments 1 and 2 used the local recognition paradigm, and in this section I address the derivations of predictions from the theories under investigation for this paradigm. Derivations for the predictions for the modified Sternberg task are addressed in the introduction to Experiment 3. In the experiments with the local recognition task, each list was followed by six probes. There were two presentation conditions. In the serial condition, items were presented from left to right, and probes appeared in the same left–right order. In the random condition, items were presented in random order across the frames, and probes were displayed in a new random order. Thus, in the random condition, serial position of presentation is deconfounded from serial position of test. I focus here on serial position of presentation—that is, the order in which items are presented. With one exception (position of origin of intrusion probes; see below), serial position is defined as the position of the probed frame in the presentation order. For example, in the random condition a list might be A(3), B(1), C(4), D(2). Frame 3 would then be assigned serial position 1; frame 1 would receive serial position 2; frame 4, position 3; and frame 2, position 4. Perfor- mance on a probe presented in frame 3 would contribute to accuracy and latency measures for serial position 1, performance on a probe in frame 1 would count toward measures for position 2, and so on. I assume that serial position affects the strength of a memory representation, denoted S in the preceding equations. The purpose of the present article is not to explain serial position effects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="66" class="deo:Reference">Oberauer, 2003</xref>, for a discussion of explanations of serial position effects), so the models capture them in a purely descriptive way. I assume that after encoding a list, each item’s strength is determined by a primacy gradient falling off exponentially from the start and a recency gradient falling off exponentially from the end. An additional factor to be taken into consideration is output interference. In the random condition of the present experiments, test position is uncorrelated with list position, so output interference is averaged out in the serial position curves. However, in the serial presentation condition, test position is perfectly correlated with list position, and this implies that items toward the end of the<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> list suffer more output interference. I model output interference as a linear decline in strength over test position. Taken together, the strength of the item in serial position i, tested at test position t, is S i,t P i 1 R n i tN, (7) where n is the list length, P and R are free parameters for the steepness of the primacy and the recency gradient, respectively, and N is a free parameter for output interference. Thus, representations at the beginning or the end of the list are stronger than those in the middle of the list, and items become weaker when they are probed later in the test sequence.</region>

      <section class="DoCO:Section">
        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="69" page="5" column="2">Predictions From the Single-Process Model</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="85" page="5" column="2">The mathematical expressions for the predictions from the two models are provided in the Appendix; here I give a verbal explanation. Positive probes match exactly one episode with regard to both content and position, returning a similarity value of 1. Similarity to all other episodes is fairly low, so global match will be largely determined by the matching item. That item’s strength is determined by its serial position, with higher strength values in the primacy and recency portions than in the middle. Therefore, accuracies should show a U-shaped serial position curve, and RTs an inverse U-shaped curve. New probes match one episode on the position dimension— namely, the episode involving the probed position, but they do not match that episode on the item dimension, so similarity to that episode will be substantially below 1. Similarity to all other episodes is again fairly small. The global match value will thus be low, but it will be somewhat higher in the primacy and recency portions than in the middle of the list, because the partially matching episode has more strength in the primacy and recency positions. Intrusion probes match the episode in the probed position p on the position dimension and the episode in the probe’s position of origin o on the item identity dimension. Thus, the overall match of an intrusion probe includes the similarity on the item dimension multiplied by the strength term for o, and the similarity on the position dimension multiplied by the strength term for p. As a consequence, the global match value will be determined by the strength of the probed position as well as by the strength of the position of origin of the probe. The relative contribution of these two strength components depends on the relative weight of the two dimensions of similarity, governed by parameter u in Equation 2. To summarize, the global match values of all three probe types will be larger in the primacy and recency positions than in the middle positions. All probe types are therefore more likely to be accepted when a primacy or a recency position is probed. This leads to primacy and recency advantages for positive probes. Accepting new and intrusion probes, however, is incorrect, and therefore serial position curves of accuracy for these probes will show the inverse shape of those for positive probes, with lower accuracy in primacy and recency positions. A similar expectation can be formulated for RTs of correct responses. Positive probes in the strong primacy and recency positions will be accepted more easily and therefore faster; negative probes in the strong primacy and recency positions will be more difficult to reject and therefore will elicit longer RTs for correct rejections. <marker type="page" number="6"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> Consider, for example, a list A(1), B(2), C(3). A positive probe A(1) matches the episode in the strong primacy position on both dimensions and therefore generates a high match value, leading with high likelihood to a fast hit. A new probe presented in the same frame, D(1), would match the strong primacy position on the context dimension, again leading to a (for new probes) relatively high match value, which results in a high chance of a false alarm or a slow rejection. Finally, an intrusion probe in the same frame, B(1), would receive a relatively high contribution to its match value from the context dimension, but a comparatively low contribution from the item dimension, because its position of origin is the weak middle position. This last example shows that the match values of intrusion probes, and therefore the difficulty of rejecting them, is a function of their list position p (i.e., the position of the probed frame) and their position of origin o. In both cases, stronger serial positions—that is, primacy and recency positions—should lead to more false alarms and slower rejections.<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> These intuitive predictions are borne out when the model is run. The predictions of the SP model are shown in the left column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" id="76" class="deo:Reference">Figure 2</xref> (for accuracies) and of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" id="77" class="deo:Reference">Figure 3</xref> (for latencies). These predictions were generated with parameters given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="78" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref>. The parameters for this and the other model predictions in this article were chosen to provide approximate fits to the serial position curves of accuracies and RTs of positive probes, and to the overall level of negative probes. Thus, the parameter settings were in- formed only by aspects of the data that are not the main focus of investigation in the present article; the shapes of the serial position curves for new and intrusion probes can be regarded as real predictions. The first two panels in each column of Figures 2 and 3 show predictions for serial position curves, with serial position defined as list position (i.e., the position of the probed frame in the presentation order of the list). Predictions for the serial condition are in the top panel. The contribution of output interference is<marker type="page" number="7"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> noticeable in the asymmetry of the curve, with weaker performance toward the end of the list. The middle panel shows predictions for the random condition, in which differences of test order are averaged out; consequently, the curves are symmetrical. In both cases, the serial position curves for new and intrusion probes bow in the direction opposite to that for the positive probe. The curvature is much less pronounced for the two kinds of negative probes than for the positive probes because the match values of negative probes have a smaller relative contribution from the strength of the probed position, as their similarity to that episode is lower. The bottom panel shows predictions for intrusion probes plotted by their position of origin (averaging over probe position). There is again a slight curvature opposite to that for positive probes, this time arising from the strength of the position of origin, which contributes to the match values of intrusion probes.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="94" page="8" column="1">In the DP model, serial position effects come about entirely through recollection. Recollection 1 consists of retrieving the item or items associated with the relevant context. In the case of a positive probe, this process will return a match, the strength of which is determined by the strength of the probed position. In the case of a negative or an intrusion probe, Recollection 1 will return a mismatch, the strength of which again reflects the strength of the probed position. Therefore, to the degree that Recollection 1 contributes to overall recollection, probes in strong list positions can be expected to elicit high hit rates and high rates of correct rejections, both with relatively short latencies. Recollection 2 consists of trying to retrieve a list context from the probe as cue. In local recognition that is the frame in which the probe has been presented, if it has been a list item at all. In the case of a positive probe this is the frame in the probed position, and the strength of the match value is determined again by the probed position. In the case of a negative probe, no frame is retrieved. The strength of the resulting mismatch value cannot depend on serial position and thus is assumed to be 1; therefore, Recollection 2 does not generate serial-position effects for new probes. For intrusion probes, however, the position of origin can be retrieved as a context, and this information would help to reject that probe. The mismatch value returned by Recollection 2 for intrusion probes therefore is weighted by the strength of the position of origin of the probe. As a consequence, Recollection 2 should produce serial- position effects for intrusion probes when plotted over their position of origin. Again, strong positions lead to larger mismatch values, which translate into faster and more accurate rejection of intrusion probes. Therefore, the predicted serial position curves for intrusion probes over position of origin bend in the same direction as the serial position curves for positive probes. To summarize, the DP model predicts that serial position curves of accuracies and latencies will bow in the same direction for all three probe types. The predictions based on parameters given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="92" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref> can be seen in the right column of Figures 2 and 3. Predicted serial position curves for new probes are shallower than those for positive and intrusion probes because recollection plays a smaller role in the decisions on new probes, which can be rejected on their lack of familiarity, than on the other two probe types, which must recruit recollection to distinguish between them. An additional prediction is that success in rejecting intrusion probes should increase with the strength of those probes’ positions of origin. Again, strong positions of origin would lead to better performance. This prediction is illustrated in the bottom right panels of Figures 2 and 3. The predictions for serial position effects on new and intrusion probes, as plotted in Figures 2 and 3, hold only if both directions of recollection contribute to the overall recognition signal. This is the case for the value of parameter d 0.5 used to generate the plotted predictions. The model’s behavior changes when d assumes more extreme values. With d 1.0, the model uses only Recollection 1 , and as a consequence, the serial position curve of intrusion probes over their position of origin becomes flat. Con- versely, for d 0.0, the model uses only Recollection 2 , and the serial position curve for new probes and intrusion probes over the probed list position becomes flat (the predictions for positive probes do not change because for them, probed position and<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> position of origin is identical, rendering d ineffective). Therefore, we can use the serial position curves of new and intrusion probes not only to adjudicate between DP and SP but also to diagnose the role of the two retrieval directions within a viable DP model.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="101" page="8" column="2">Each trial started with the presentation of a row of six square frames in the middle of a computer screen in white on a black background. After 500 ms, six consonants were presented in white, one in each frame, with a presentation time of 400 ms followed by an interstimulus interval of 100 ms for each letter. The two conditions of presentation order, serial and random, were realized in separate blocks in counterbalanced order. In the serial condition, the consonants were presented from left to right; in the random condition, their presentation order was determined at random for each trial and participant. Lists were built by randomly selecting from the 20 consonants (excluding Y) without repetitions. The first probe appeared 600 ms after offset of the last list item in one of the frames (for an illustration, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="100" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref>). Participants judged whether the probe matched the letter presented in that frame by pressing the left or the right arrow key; the assignment of the arrow keys to “yes” or “no” was chosen by each participant at the beginning of the experiment. The next probe followed 200 ms after the response, for a total of six probes. In the serial presentation condition, the probes were presented in left-to-right order, thereby matching the order of list presentation across the frames. In the random condition presentation of probes followed a new random order independent of list presentation order. Serial position is defined as position in the presentation order. In Experiment 1, across all trials 50% of probes were positive and the remaining ones were negative, with 24% new and 26% intrusion probes. In Experiment 2, each probe corresponded to a different letter of the list; half of them were positive and half were intrusion probes. In both experiments, positive probes were evenly distributed over serial positions across all trials of the experiment in a randomized order, whereas serial positions of negative probes were determined at random without constraints. Each participant completed 12 practice trials followed by 156 test trials (each with six probes) in a 1-hr session. At the end of</region>

All four figures show that serial position curves of intrusion probes tracked those of positive probes remarkably well. The serial position curves of new probes in Experiment 1 tended to be shallower, but where they were bent, they were bent in the same direction as positive probes. This pattern is incompatible with SP, but it matches the predictions of DP very well. This impression was confirmed by analyses of variance (ANOVAs) in which serial position was coded by linear and quadratic contrasts to capture trends in the curves. In one case— latencies in the serial presentation condition—the cubic rather than the quadratic trend was considered because a cubic trend was strongly implied by the data. Out of 24 analyses of interactions between serial position and probe type 3 only 5 became significant at the conventional .05 alpha level. Three of those concerned the comparison of positive and new probes in Experiment 1: In the serial condition, positive versus new probes interacted with the quadratic trend of serial position effects on accuracies, F(1, 29) 9.2, p .005, 2 p .24. This interaction reflects the fact that new probes do not show the one-item recency effect observed for positive probes. In the random condition, positive versus new probes interacted with the quadratic trend on both accuracies and RTs, F(1, 29) 9.2, p .005, 2 p .24 for accuracies, and F(1, 29) 5.8, p .023, 2 p .17 for RTs. These two interactions reflect the fact that serial position curves for new probes were essentially flat in the random condition, whereas positive probes displayed primacy and recency effects. One of the two remaining interactions signals the lack of the one-item recency effect in accuracies of intrusion probes in the serial-presentation condition of Experiment 2, F(1, 29) 4.6, p .041, 2 p .14. The other reflects the different shape of the accuracy position curves of positive and intrusion probes in Experiment 1, random condition, F(1, 29) 4.3, p .047, 2 p .13. Primacy and recency effects extended further into the middle of the list for intrusion probes than for positive probes. These two effects were small and appear to be unsystematic, so I do not discuss them further. In those cases where the interactions were not significant, it is important to show that this was not due to small serial position effects or to a lack of power. To this end I tested for serial position effects of individual probe types; the results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" id="115" class="deo:Reference">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" id="116" class="deo:Reference">Table 3</xref>. Out of 10 significant serial position effects for positive probes, 6 were replicated in the data from intrusion probes. Those not replicated were, in both experiments, the quadratic trends on accuracy in the serial condition, and the quadratic trends on latencies in the random condition.

The SP model predicts that serial position curves for negative probes (i.e., new and intrusion probes) bow in the direction opposite from those for positive probes. The DP model predicts that they bow in the same direction, with relatively shallow curvature for new probes and more pronounced curvature for positive and intrusion probes. The predictions of the DP were further modulated by the assumed direction of retrieval involved in recollection. Context-to-item retrieval predicts bowed serial position curves of negative probes plotted over the list position of the probed frame, whereas item-to-context retrieval predicts bowed serial position curves for intrusion probes when plotted over their position of origin.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="149" page="12" column="1">The results contradict the predictions of SP but are in good agreement with those of DP. Support for DP comes from the paucity of interactions between probe type and serial position and the finding of a number of significant serial-position effects on negative probes that had the same shape as those of positive probes in the same conditions. Where positive and negative position curves were not parallel, the interactions mostly came from the fact that new probes displayed shallower position curves, and this is predicted by the DP model (see Figures 2 and 3). The predictions of both retrieval directions within DP were supported, suggesting that both retrieval routes contribute with substantial weight to recollection. This result implies that the serial position effects on <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> intrusion probes in the random condition are split between an effect of the probed position and an effect of the position of origin. As a consequence, serial position effects on intrusion probes are predicted to be less pronounced than those for positive probes in the random condition, a prediction also visible in Figures 2 and 3. This could explain why, in the random condition, not all position effects observed for positive probes were replicated in the intrusion probes. There was one conspicuous discrepancy between the predictions of DP and the data, namely the cubic rather than quadratic trend in the serial position curves of latencies for the serial presentation condition. The cubic trend can be interpreted as a combination of an inverse U-shaped curve, which is predicted by the DP model, with a substantial time added to the first list item. The same pattern of latencies has been observed for forward serial recall—the time for recalling the first item is much longer than the times for recalling successive items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="147" class="deo:Reference">Anderson &amp; Matessa, 1997</xref>; Maybery, Parmentier, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="148" class="deo:Reference">Jones, 2002</xref>). This long latency on the first item has nothing to do with its strength, because the first list item is typically recalled best, and it showed best recognition accuracy in the present experiments. A plausible interpretation is that, when a forward test order is anticipated, participants take time for prepar- ing retrieval of the whole list in order before responding to the first item. The DP model could easily be amended by a further free parameter to capture this additional preparation time.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="170" page="12" column="2">The SP model computes global match from the similarities of the probe to all six memory episodes. Similarity is computed from the distance on the item dimension and the context dimension (i.e., color). Similarity is weighted by the strength of each episode, which depends on its serial position. Serial position effects are assumed to apply to the whole series of six items regardless of its subdivision into two lists; thus, the strongest items are the first item of the first list and the last item of the second list. The equations resulting from the application of the SP model to the modified Sternberg task are given in the Appendix. The predictions are illustrated on the left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9" id="154" class="deo:Reference">Figure 9</xref> (for accuracies) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10" id="155" class="deo:Reference">Figure 10</xref> (for latencies). These predictions, and those for the DP model described below, were generated with the same parameters as those for the local recognition tasks (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="156" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref>), with one exception: Because the global match values were higher in the case<marker type="page" number="13"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> of the modified Sternberg task due to more matches of all probes on the context dimension, the acceptance criterion in Equation A1 had to be raised to avoid a strong bias toward accepting probes. The two panels in each column show predictions for the two orders<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> of presenting the short and the long list. Data points belonging to the same list are connected. Predictions for positive probes are plotted by their serial position in the relevant list. Predictions for intrusion probes are plotted by their serial position in the irrelevant<marker type="page" number="14"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> list. New probes do not have serial positions in this paradigm, but they can be differentiated by the list length of the relevant list; the predictions for new probes for long lists, N(L), and for short lists, N(S), are plotted on the right side of each panel. The SP model predicts once again that serial position curves for intrusion probes are inversely bowed relative to those of positive probes. The SP model also predicts that intrusion probes are more difficult to reject than new probes because intrusion probes gain in match value from their similarity to an irrelevant-list item. In addition, the model predicts that new probes and intrusion probes are harder to reject when the relevant list is long, because these probes match more memory episodes on the context dimension, thereby generating larger match values (note that intrusion probes from long lists correspond to shorter relevant lists). For positive probes, the SP model predicts the opposite—positive probes from short lists are predicted to be more difficult because they match fewer memory items on the context dimension.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="173" page="14" column="1">Whereas in local recognition Recollection 1 consists of retrieving one item associated with a single position cue, in the modified Sternberg task Recollection 1 consists of retrieving all items from the relevant list and comparing them to the probe. If a match is found, the outcome M is set to 1, and if no match is found, M 1. In case of a match, M is multiplied with the strength of the matching item, and in case of no match, M is multiplied with the average strength of all items on the relevant list. The attempt to retrieve all items in the relevant list could be a serial or a parallel process, but in either case we should expect Recollection 1 to become more difficult as the length of the relevant list increases. Therefore, strength is reduced with increasing list length of the relevant list; this reduction is governed by a free parameter C (see Equation A15 in the Appendix). For Recollection 2 , strength is computed as in local recognition, because in both tasks item-to-context retrieval in- volves retrieval of a single context from a single probe as cue. 4 The predictions of the DP model are shown on the right side of Figures 9 and 10. As before, the model predicts largely parallel serial position curves for positive and intrusion probes. Intrusion probes are predicted to be more difficult than new probes because familiarity is added to the recognition signal. In addition, DP predicts list length effects in favor of short relevant lists for positive and for new probes. Positive probes are accepted more easily when the relevant list is short because memory traces have more strength, making it easier for Recollection 1 to find the matching item in the relevant list. New probes are easier to reject when the relevant list is short for the same reason: It is easier for Recollection 1 to determine that the probe does not match any of the relevant-list items. The predictions for intrusion probes are not straightforward: The list length effect on strength makes intrusion probes easier to reject through Recollection 1 when the relevant list is short, for the same reasons as with new probes. At the same time, these intrusion probes originate from the long list, which renders strength for Recollection 2 smaller on average, due to the trough in the serial position curve. Once again, certain features of the predictions of DP enable identification of the effects of context-to-item recollection and of item-to-context recollection. When d is set to 0, eliminating <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> context-to-item retrieval, the list length effect for new probes disappears. When d is set to 1, eliminating item-to-context retrieval, serial position effects for intrusion probes disappear.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="177" page="14" column="2">The materials consisted of 400 one- and two-syllable German nouns. In each trial, six nouns were selected at random from this pool, with the constraint that the nouns have not been used as memory items in any previous trial of the same block. The six selected words were assigned at random to the six serial positions. The set of six words was subdivided into two lists. For participants in the long–short group, the first four words formed the first list, and the remaining two words formed the second list. For the short–long group, the first two words formed the first list and the other four words formed the second list. Each of the two sessions consisted of eight blocks of 32 trials each. In each trial, the six words were presented centrally one by one for 700 ms, followed by a 100-ms blank interval. The first list of two or four words (depending on group) was displayed in red, and the second list was displayed in blue on a black background. Half a second following the offset of the last word, a red or blue frame appeared centrally; its color indicated which list should be regarded as relevant. The probe appeared in the frame 100 ms later in the same color as the frame. Participants were instructed to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether the probe was contained in the relevant list. They gave their responses by pressing on the left or the right arrow key. Immediate feedback followed a key press in the form of a brief high tone for correct responses and a low tone for incorrect responses. The next trial began 1.5 s after the feedback tone.

This list length effect, however, is an effect of the total number of elements in working memory, which is a constant of six in all experiments reported here, and therefore does not need to be modeled explicitly. At least part of it is implicitly modeled by the fact that with longer lists, the primacy and recency parameters decline further, leaving the middle list positions weaker than with shorter lists.

Mean accuracies on positive and intrusion probes are presented by serial position for the two groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11" id="185" class="deo:Reference">Figure 11</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12" id="186" class="deo:Reference">Figure 12</xref> shows the corresponding RT data. Data points connected by lines reflect serial positions within the same list. The figures also show the data for new probes by the length of the relevant list. The first set of analyses focuses on serial position curves. The SP model predicts that these curves bow in opposite directions for positive and intrusion probes, whereas the DP model predicts that their shapes are parallel. I tested these hypotheses separately for the two groups because serial position effects differed between groups, but there was no hypothesis concerning the interaction of serial position effects with group. I conducted an ANOVA for each group, each dependent measure, and each list, with probe type (positive vs. intrusion) and serial position as independent variables. For long lists, I tested for interactions of linear and of quadratic trends over serial position with probe type. Of the 12 interactions (2 for long lists and 1 for short lists 2 dependent variables and 2 groups), 4 were significant. For accuracies, these involved the quadratic trend of serial position in the short–long group, F(1, 15) 6.4, p .02, 2 p .30, and the linear trend in the long–short group, F(1, 15) 10.4, p .006, 2 p .41. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11" id="187" class="deo:Reference">Figure 11</xref>, both of these interactions are derived from the fact that intrusion probes were responded to less accurately on the serial positions where the irrelevant list bordered the relevant list (i.e., the first position in the short–long group, and the last two positions in the long–short group). For RTs, the significant interactions involved the linear trend in the short–long group, F(1, 15) 8.0, p .013, 2 p .35, and the quadratic trend in the long–short group, F(1, 15) 11.7, p .004, 2 p .44. The first of these interactions reflects a more pronounced recency advantage for positive than for intrusion probes when the long list came last. The second interaction is driven mainly by the pronounced increase in RTs for intrusion probes at the last position of the long list, which borders the short list following it, whereas no such increase was found for positive probes. For 8 of 12 analyses there was no significant interaction of serial position with probe type, but that does not imply that the two probe types show parallel effects of serial position. To test whether they do, I analyzed serial position effects for positive and for intrusion probes separately; the results of these analyses are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4" id="188" class="deo:Reference">Table 4</xref>. In 6 of the 12 comparisons, there were significant effects in the same direction for positive and for intrusion probes. The second analysis tests the hypothesis, shared by the two models, that intrusion probes were responded to less quickly and accurately than new probes. ANOVAs with probe type (new vs. intrusion), length of the relevant list (2 vs. 4), and group as independent variables yielded significant main effects of probe type for both accuracy and RT as dependent variable, F(1, 31) 92.3, p .001, 2 p .76, and F(1, 31) 145.7, p .001, 2 p .83, respectively.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="200" page="16" column="2">The results of Experiment 3 are inconsistent with the SP model on two accounts: Serial position curves for positive and for intrusion probes were mostly parallel, and list length effects of positive and new probes went in the same direction, with better performance on trials with short relevant lists. Both these patterns were predicted by the DP model. The third prediction of the DP model, better performance on new than on intrusion probes, was also confirmed. Moreover, the experiment yielded support for both retrieval directions within the DP model. Item-to-context retrieval was demonstrated by the effect of the serial position of origin on intrusion probes. Context-to-item retrieval was demonstrated by the list length effect on new probes. There were four deviations between serial position curves of positive and intrusion probes, which are not predicted by DP. Three of them reflect a specific difficulty with intrusion probes coming from positions close to the relevant list. These effects can be understood as arising from a difficulty in discriminating between the two lists. If representations of adjacent serial positions overlap, as is assumed in contemporary models of serial-order memory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="198" class="deo:Reference">Burgess &amp; Hitch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="199" class="deo:Reference">Henson, 1998</xref>), recall of the list context from a probe as cue will lead to ambiguous results if the list context lies at the boundary between the two lists. This is true for both positive and intrusion probes but, whereas for positive probes information from familiarity converges with information from recollection, thereby rendering accurate recollection of the probe’s list context somewhat redundant, discriminating between relevant and irrelevant list is crucial for decisions on intrusion probes. This explains why performance on intrusion probes suffers more than that on positive probes at serial positions close to the list boundary. The DP model in its current form does not include a parameter for discriminability between contexts, but including one would be a straightforward extension. The fourth point of deviation between serial position effects of positive and intrusion probes was the larger recency effect in RTs to positive probes in the short–long group. One tentative explanation for this effect is that, in addition to serial position effects on recollection, there is also a recency effect on the degree of familiarity, which helps acceptance of recent positive probes but impairs rejection of recent intrusion probes. The fact that there was nev- ertheless a recency advantage even for intrusion probes, and the interaction of probe type and serial position was not found for the short list in the long–short group, shows that this effect cannot be very strong. A strong recency effect on familiarity would have driven the observed recency effects on positive and on intrusion probes in opposite directions, and this was not the case.</region>

Both models incorporated the distinction between item information and contex- tual information and therefore could handle the fact that relational recognition was more difficult than item recognition. The two models could be distinguished by their predictions for serial position effects on negative, to-be-rejected probes, and (in Experiment 3) by their predictions for list length effects. The DP model predicted largely parallel serial position curves for all probe types and parallel list length effects for positive and new probes, whereas the SP model predicted that both of these effects go in opposite directions for positive and negative probes. The results of all three experiments clearly favor the DP model. In addition, the results provide support for two assumed directions of retrieval in the recollection component of the DP model. Recollection is based on context-to-item retrieval and on item-to-context retrieval.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="211" page="17" column="1">Which characteristics of the models are responsible for the success of the DP model and the failure of the SP model? Two critical features can be identified. First, the SP model uses a signal that reflects only positive evidence for a match, whereas a mismatch is simply represented by a relative lack of match evidence. As a consequence, strong representations elicit stronger evidence for a match with a positive probe, thereby making hits easier, but they do not elicit stronger evidence for a mismatch with a negative probe. Thus, the SP model has no mechanism to generate better performance on negative probes presented in stronger serial positions. The recollection process in the DP model, in contrast, provides evidence for a match (positive values of M) as well as for a mismatch (negative values of M). Therefore, stronger items yield stronger evidence for a match when compared with a positive probe and stronger evidence for a mismatch when compared with a negative probe. The second critical feature is that the SP model compares each probe to all episodes in memory, whereas the DP model has one process, familiarity, that compares the probe to all memory items, and another process, recollection, that is limited to the relevant item or items. The importance of this second feature can be <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> demonstrated by investigating a variant of the SP model that introduces the first feature, positive evidence for a mismatch. To do so, we can subtract from the similarity between the probe and each episode a neutral baseline B that represents the value on the similarity scale at which the evidence is inconclusive.

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="217" page="17" column="2">With this modification, mismatches of a probe with an episode in a strong position would yield negative values multiplied with a large value S i , thereby providing stronger evidence for rejection, compared with mismatches of a probe with an episode in a weak position. Nonetheless, this modified SP model still predicts serial position curves for negative probes that mirror those for positive probes, rather than being parallel. This is so because the evidence for a probe’s match or mismatch is summed across all memory episodes, rather than being confined to the relevant set of episodes. Consider two new probes in the local recognition task, one in the strong serial position 1 and one in the weaker serial position 3. For both of them there will be positive evidence for a mismatch coming from all six memory episodes on the item dimension, and from five memory episodes on the context dimension. Both of them, however, also receive one piece of evidence for a match, namely a match on the context dimension with the episode on the probed position. For the probe in the strong position 1 this evidence for a match is stronger than for the probe in the weak position 3, and therefore the global match of a new probe in position 1 is larger, making it more difficult to reject that probe. There is a way of formulating an SP model that comes very close to realizing both critical features. In this version of SP, memory episodes are encoded by values between 0 and 1 on each feature dimension, with a neutral value of 0.5. Values greater than 0.5 represent the presence of a feature, and values less than 0.5 represent its absence. An interpretation of these values is that they represent the conditional probability of a feature, given the pres- <marker type="page" number="18"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> ence of an object or an episode. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="216" class="deo:Reference">McClelland and Chappell (1998)</xref> built their subjective-likelihood model on this representation assumption; the SP model considered next is a much simplified version of that model, designed to investigate how far an SP model can be pushed in explaining the present data. The strength of a memory episode determines how much a feature value deviates from the neutral value 0.5:</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="224" page="18" column="1">In this expression, D represents the distance between the probe and the memory episode i, defined as the absolute difference between the probe’s feature value (0 or 1) and the episode’s feature value f i,d on the respective dimension. Parameter u determines the relative contributions of item and context dimension. The global match is computed by adding up the matches of a probe to all memory episodes. This version of the SP model creates positive evidence for a mismatch, which increases with strength: The more f i,d deviates from 0.5, the smaller D becomes in case of a match, and the larger D becomes in case of a mismatch, thereby generating stronger evidence for accepting positive probes and stronger evidence for rejecting negative probes. Therefore, the model meets the first requirement for a successful model: symmetric evidence for matches and mismatches. Importantly, the model also has the second critical feature, the ability to limit comparison to relevant contexts. Due to the multiplicative combination of the match values on the two dimensions, the model implies to some degree the exclusion of items in irrelevant contexts. Items associated to irrelevant contexts (i.e., items in different frames than the probed one in local recognition, and items from the irrelevant list in the modified Sternberg task) mismatch the probe on the context dimension, thereby returning a low value of [1 – D ctx ]. Whatever the match of that episode on the item dimension, [1 – D item ], it carries little weight because it is multiplied with the low value on the context dimension before being added to the global match signal. This modified SP model predicts the serial position curves of the two experiments much better than the original SP model. Illustra- tive predictions, with parameter settings tuned to the serial position curves of positive probes, are presented on the left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13" id="221" class="deo:Reference">Figure 13</xref> for local recognition and on the right side for the modified Sternberg task. There is one noticeable qualitative deviation of the predictions from the data, however: For the modified Sternberg task the new SP model predicts that performance on positive probes increases with longer relevant lists. The opposite was found in Experiment 3. The reason for this misprediction is that with a short relevant list, positive probes accumulate evidence for mismatch on the context dimension from twice as many memory episodes— namely, all four irrelevant-list items—than with a long relevant list. Despite its relative success, the modified SP model makes this one wrong prediction because it does not fully exclude the epi-<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> sodes from the irrelevant list from the comparison process. Spe- cifically, whereas information from different dimensions within an episode is integrated multiplicatively—thereby discounting evidence from one dimension when there is a mismatch on the other—the matching signals across episodes are integrated addi- tively, such that mismatch evidence grows linearly with the length of the irrelevant list. There is no obvious way to solve this problem within the framework of SP models that base recognition decisions on a global match value between the probe and all memory episodes. One way out is to abandon global matching in favor of local matching—that is, to compute a probe’s match only over the relevant set of episodes. This is essentially what the recollection process of the DP model does. A single-process model based only on local matching could explain list-length and serial-position effects, but it could not explain intrusion costs: When irrelevant episodes are completely excluded from the comparison process, intrusion probes are not harder to reject than new probes. I con- cluded that, although there is room within the general framework of SP models for improving on the SP model I considered initially, accounting for the whole pattern of data from both paradigms is a challenge not easily met by any model from that family. The two features identified as necessary to account for the present data are the same as those identified as necessary to explain another set of findings on short-term recognition (Oberauer &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="223" class="deo:Reference">Lange, 2007</xref>). In that work we applied a version of the present DP model to data from the modified Sternberg task with nonwords as items. Memory was tested with a number of probe types designed to distinguish memory for individual letters and memory for their bindings. The ability of the DP model to exclude irrelevant-list items from recollection, while at the same time being sensitive to the familiarity arising from them, and the ability to garner positive evidence for a mismatch as well as for a match, proved critical for the DP model’s success in accounting for those data. Thus, there is converging evidence from two sets of experiments for the two critical features of a successful model.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="225" page="18" column="2">Three Sources of Recognition Information</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="239" page="18" column="2">The present findings not only help to identify challenges for SP models of short-term recognition, they also place constraints on DP models. The successful DP model I propose uses three sources of information for a recognition decision: familiarity and the two retrieval routes of recollection. Can we reduce this account to two sources of information? One possibility to consider is that item-to-context retrieval is unnecessary to explain the data. The evidence for this process is the serial position curve for intrusion probes when plotted by position of origin, displaying primacy and recency effects. In principle, such a serial position curve could arise from position effects of familiarity. If, for some reason, items at the beginning and the end of a list are less familiar than those in the middle, then it would be more difficult to overcome the misleading familiarity of intrusion probes stemming from middle list position than that of intrusion probes from the primacy and the recency part of the list. There is, however, no reason to assume that items in the primacy and recency part of a list elicit a weaker familiarity signal. If anything, the primacy and recency effects on acceptance of positive probes suggest the opposite. The item-to-context retrieval <marker type="page" number="19"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> hypothesis, in contrast, affords an explanation that can be applied equally to all serial position curves reported in this article: Bindings between items and their contexts are stronger at the beginning and end of a list than in the middle, and this strength is symmetrical for item-to-context retrieval and for context-to-item retrieval. The same explanation would also apply for cued recall, which generates similar serial position curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="231" class="deo:Reference">Oberauer, 2003</xref>). Why bindings are stronger in the primacy and recency portion is a question for future research. A second possibility to reduce the DP model to just two sources of information would be to eliminate familiarity assessment as a separate process and explain intrusion costs through item-to-context retrieval instead, as follows: Successful retrieval of a context for a probe would result in high familiarity, whereas failure would result in low familiarity. Positive and intrusion probes would both be highly familiar because they are associated with a context in the current list. New probes could at best serve to retrieve older contexts (e.g., previous lists in the experiment or extra-experimental contexts), and the associations to these contexts can be assumed to have weakened over time,<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> so that retrieving the context of a new probe results in lower familiarity. This account of intrusion costs, however, faces the same problem as the SP theory. It predicts that intrusion costs should be larger for probes that are strongly associated to their contexts than for probes weakly associated to their contexts, because strongly associated probes generate more misleading familiarity. The U-shaped serial position curves over position of origin would then imply that intrusion probes from the middle of the list are more strongly bound to their contexts than are probes from the primacy or recency portion. This assumption cannot be ruled out, but it makes it difficult to explain why serial position curves for positive probes show higher hit rates in the primacy and recency portion. If familiarity is stronger for items in the middle position by virtue of stronger item-to-context associations, the only way that primacy and recency items could attract higher hit rates is for them to have much stronger context-to-item associations than those in the middle. This would mean that the strength of context-to-item associations is inversely related across serial positions to the strength of item-to-context associations. I think this is a very implausible assumption.<marker type="page" number="20"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> The present DP model is tailored to short-term recognition tasks in which typically short lists are presented, for which recollection of the complete list is feasible. Recollection 1 relied on the ability to retrieve all items associated with the relevant list context— which in most paradigms is the whole list presented for the current trial—to ascertain for negative probes that they do not match any of them. Researchers interested in recognition from long-term memory usually ask people to learn much longer lists than those used in the present experiments, and learning is often separated from the test phase by a filled delay. I assume that with increasing length of the relevant list and increasing delay between study and test, people rely less on context-to-item recollection. In the limit, recollection should consist entirely of item-to-context recollection (i.e., Recollection 2 ). One prediction arising from this assumption is that list-length effects should flatten out in the longer range, because the contribution of the list-length parameter C, which is mediated through Recollection 1 , diminishes with increasing list length. In fact, the slope of RTs over list length flattens out as list length is increased from 2 to 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="237" class="deo:Reference">Burrows &amp; Okada, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="238" class="deo:Reference">Okada &amp; Burrows, 1978</xref>).</region>
