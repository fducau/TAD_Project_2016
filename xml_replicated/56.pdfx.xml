      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="15">Emotions in Bargaining 2 Abstract Previous research on the communication of emotions suggested that bargainers obtain higher outcomes if they communicate anger than if they communicate happiness, because anger signals higher limits which in turn leads opponents to give in. Building on a social functional account of communicated emotions, we demonstrate that the behavioral consequences of communicated anger strongly depend on structural characteristics of the bargaining situation. The results of three experimental studies on ultimatum bargaining corroborate the notion that communicated anger signals higher limits, and that emotion effects are contingent on bargainers’ expectation that low offers will be rejected. The data also indicate, however, that communicating anger in bargaining may backfire. The findings suggest that bargainers who communicate anger may obtain lower outcomes (a) when their opponent has a possibility to deceive them during bargaining, and (b) when the consequences of rejecting their opponent’s offer are low. Taken together, the current article reveals the boundary conditions of successful communication of anger in bargaining. Keywords: emotions, bargaining, deception, fairness, self-interest <marker type="page" number="4"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 3 A Social Functional Approach to Emotions in Bargaining: When Communicating Anger Pays and when it Backfires Bargaining can be described as "the process whereby two or more parties attempt to settle what each shall give and take, or perform and receive, in a transaction between them" (Rubin &amp; Brown, 1975, p. 2). Whereas this definition adequately captures the fact that bargaining is a mixed-motive situation (Komorita &amp; Parks, 1996; Pruitt &amp; Carnevale, 1993), it may not adequately capture how bargainers perceive the situation they are in. For one thing, it does not acknowledge that bargaining is often a highly emotional and heated process. During bargaining, for example, bargainers may become angry. How do emotions affect the bargaining process and outcomes? Remarkably, the role of emotions--which seems so central to situations of conflict--has only received limited attention in the bargaining literature. In the current article, we focus on the interpersonal effects of communicated emotions in bargaining. More specifically, we investigate how communicated emotions convey information about one’s limits during bargaining, and how these inferences subsequently<marker type="block"/> translate into behavior.</region>

Moreover, the social functional account of the informational value of communicated</outsider>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="27">Emotions in Bargaining 4 emotions implies that bargainers will take this information as a basis for their own bargaining behavior if it is functional for them to do so. Thus, a social functional account of interpersonal effects of emotions in bargaining assumes that (a) communicated emotions lead to informational inferences, and (b) these informational inferences have behavioral consequences. Of the interpersonal emotions during bargaining, anger has received most attention. The basic question that researchers have addressed is whether anger has disruptive or perhaps positive effects in bargaining (e.g., Sinaceur &amp; Tiedens, 2006; Van Kleef, De Dreu &amp; Manstead, 2004a, b). The results of these studies provided support for the social functions approach described above. Van Kleef et al. (2004a, b), for example, compared how bargainers reacted to an angry opponent and to a happy opponent. For this purpose, they presented their participants a negotiation task, in which they could make the first offer. Subsequently, their (simulated) opponent made a preprogrammed counteroffer, after which participants made a new offer, and the negotiation process continued. During six rounds of offers and counteroffers, participants received emotional reactions from their opponent. These reactions either signaled that the opponent was angry or happy. A series of experiments using this paradigm first of all showed that bargainers tended to reciprocate the emotions of their opponent (cf. Keltner &amp; Haidt, 1999; this reciprocal <marker type="page" number="6"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 5 competitive when feeling angry (e.g., Baron, 1990; Pillutla &amp; Murnighan, 1996; Forgas, 1998). In contrast to this notion, however, the studies by Van Kleef et al. (2004a, b) did not reveal such detrimental effects. The studies did, however, provide support for the social functional account of interpersonal effects of emotions. Supporting the notion that that communicated emotions are used as a basis for informational inferences, the findings indicated that bargainers used their opponents’ emotion to infer his or her limits. In agreement with the notion that anger may convey a sense of toughness (e.g., Clark, Pataki, &amp; Carver, 1996; Karasawa, 2001; Sinaceur &amp; Tiedens, 2006), the findings indicated that the limits of angry opponents were judged to be higher than the limits of happy opponents. In addition, the studies showed the behavioral consequences of this process by revealing that the participants made lower demands and higher concessions to an angry opponent than to a happy opponent. Moreover, the effects of the opponent’s emotion on the demands of the participants were mediated by the perceived limits of their opponent. This suggests that people give in to angry opponents because they assume that the limits of angry opponents are higher. People may then reason that agreement can only be reached if they concede (see also Frank, 1988). Based on these findings--that basically demonstrate that showing anger pays--one might conclude that a good advice for any bargainer would be to communicate anger.<marker type="page" number="7"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 6 argue that the behavioral consequences may be more differentiated. Moreover, we suggest that the behavioral consequences strongly depend on structural aspects of the bargaining situation. Our basic argument is that communicated anger--and the high limits it signals--may only lead to lower demands if the structural aspects of the bargaining situation lead bargainers to infer that conceding to the high limits is the only way to secure outcomes. We will show that structural aspects of the bargaining situation may provide bargainers with alternative means to further their own outcomes without necessarily giving in to the opponent’s high limits. Building on previous insights on structural effects in bargaining, we will demonstrate that the behavioral effects of communicated emotions strongly depend on the structural differences between the parties involved in terms of (a) the distribution of information and (b) the distribution of power. The distribution of information refers to the knowledge that bargainers have about the object of the negotiation (e.g., Roth &amp; Malouf, 1992; Samuelson, 1984). The distribution of power refers to the influence that bargainers have on each other’s outcomes, with high influence implying high power (e.g., Emerson,<marker type="block"/> 1972a, b; Lawler, 1992).</region>

The Distribution of Information and Power in Ultimatum Bargaining</outsider>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="30">Emotions in Bargaining 7 To examine the structural effects of information and power distributions we used a bargaining context that is commonly used to investigate motivated bargaining behavior. The ultimatum bargaining game was developed by Güth, Schmittberger, and Schwarze (1982), and basically models the final phase of bargaining, i.e., where bargainers make a ‘take it or leave it’ offer to their opponent. In this game, two players decide on how to distribute a certain amount of money. One of the players, the allocator, offers a proportion of the money to the other player, the recipient. If the recipient accepts, the money is distributed in agreement with the allocator's offer. If the recipient rejects the offer, both players get nothing. With its simple structure, the ultimatum bargaining game is very suited to study motivated bargaining behavior, and the structural effects we address in the current paper, the distribution of information and power.</region>

The first experiments on ultimatum bargaining demonstrated that allocators predominantly offer an equal split to the recipient, so that recipient and allocator end up with an equal amount of money (see for overviews e.g. Camerer &amp; Thaler, 1995; Güth &amp; Tietz, 1990; Handgraaf, Van Dijk, &amp; De Cremer, 2004; Thaler, 1988; Van Dijk &amp; Tenbrunsel, 2005). Initially this preference for an equal split was</region>
        <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="35" page="8" column="1">interpreted as a genuine preference for fairness. Subsequent theorizing, however, posited that allocators may only propose an equal split of the money because they anticipate that lower offers will be rejected (e.g., Camerer &amp; Thaler, 1995; Pillutla &amp; Murnighan, 1995; Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000; Weg &amp; Zwick, 1994). To study this possibility, researchers started to manipulate the distribution of information.

Because the recipient does not know about the differential value, one can offer to split the chips equally--a seemingly fair offer--without much fear of rejection. In agreement with the suggestion that equal offers that were observed in prior studies on ultimatum bargaining may have been motivated by fear of rejection of unfair offers, results indicated that participants made lower offers if they believed the recipient was not aware of the fact that chips were worth more to the allocator (see for similar findings e.g. Kagel, Kim, &amp; Moser, 1996; Pillutla &amp; Murnighan, 1995; Straub &amp; Murnighan, 1995).

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="43" confidence="possible" page="9" column="1">consequences of rejection. For example, Suleiman (1996) designed a variant of the ultimatum bargaining game, in which the consequences of rejection can be varied (see also Van Dijk,</region>
        <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="44" page="9" column="1">De Cremer, &amp; Handgraaf, 2004; Van Dijk &amp; Tenbrunsel, 2005). In this game, referred to as the "delta game," rejection of the offer means that the offer is multiplied with a factor delta (0 ≤ delta ≤ 1). Thus, for delta = 0, the delta game is identical to the standard ultimatum game (i.e., if the recipient rejects, the recipient and the allocator both end up with nothing). It is apparent that with higher values of delta, the consequences of rejection become less severe and (thus) that the relative power of the recipient is weakened (see also Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt,</outsider>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="51" page="10" column="1">Emotions in Bargaining 9 2000). For example, in the case of delta = 0.9, rejection means that the offer is only diminished by 10%, implying that the recipient is in a low power position relative to the allocator. With this variant of ultimatum bargaining, Suleiman demonstrated that as the consequences of rejection are reduced and the power position of the recipient is weakened (i.e., when delta goes up), offers go down. What these studies show, is that both the distribution of information and the distribution of power strongly affect bargaining behavior, and that the ultimatum bargaining game is highly suited to investigate the behavioral effects of such structural factors. More specifically, the studies indicate that these structural aspects of the bargaining situation affect how bargainers may deal with their opponent’s limits. Bargainers having an information advantage and/or facing a low power opponent may be less inclined to give in to the (inferred) high limits of an angry opponent. For the current purposes these insights are of special importance, because they imply that the behavioral consequences of communicating anger may be different from what the current literature would suggest, and that communicating anger may not always be an effective strategy to increase one’s outcomes in bargaining. The Present Studies We investigate effects of communicated emotions within the context of ultimatum <marker type="page" number="11"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 10 structural characteristics of the bargaining situation. More specifically Experiment 1 will demonstrate that fear of rejection may induce allocators to give in to an angry recipient, and thus that communicating anger may pay. Experiment 2 will show that if the bargaining situation allows for exchange of information, allocators may use deception as a strategic means to actively reduce the angry recipient’s limits. The results will show that under these conditions, communicating anger backfires. In Experiment 3 we manipulated power by varying consequences of rejection. The results will show that communicating anger is detrimental to recipients in a low power position. Under these conditions, communicating anger backfires because allocators do not need to fear (inferred) high limits of the angry opponent when the consequences of rejection are low. Taken together, these studies shed new light on the functionality of anger communication in bargaining by extending and qualifying previous findings and theorizing in the realm of the social functional account of emotions. Experiment 1: You may be angry but what do you know? As a starting point of our investigations we developed an ultimatum bargaining game along the lines of previous research on asymmetric information (e.g., Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000). Concentrating on allocator behavior, participants were assigned the allocator role, and they were informed that chips were worth twice as much to them as to the recipient (cf. Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000). Half of the participants learned that the recipient knew about this<marker type="page" number="12"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 11 (simulated) opponents either communicated that they were angry or happy about the offer, and the main interest was in how this affected subsequent offers. Such a procedure would not be feasible in ultimatum bargaining, however, because in ultimatum bargaining allocators only make one (take it or leave it) offer. Therefore, we adjusted the procedure, by having the participants fill out a general six-item questionnaire to supposedly assess their general views on bargaining. Their answers were supposedly sent to the recipient who then either reacted with anger or happiness. This slight adjustment not only sufficed to include a meaningful manipulation of emotion in ultimatum bargaining, it also served to remedy a potential limitation of the emotion manipulation of the Van Kleef et al. studies. One could argue that in the Van Kleef et al. studies, the manipulation of emotion also constitutes a manipulation of how attractive the offer is to the opponent. That is, by responding in anger, the opponent basically states that the offer itself is highly unacceptable. By decoupling the emotion manipulation from the actual offer, this alternative interpretation seems less viable. Our first interest was in whether we would replicate the informational and behavioral findings that have been documented in earlier negotiation research (e.g., Sinaceur &amp; Tiedens, 2006; Van Kleef, 2004a, b). Would similar effects of emotion be observed in ultimatum bargaining? And would they be as evident in the case of symmetric information as in the case of asymmetric information? We anticipated two possibilities. The first possibility was that we<marker type="page" number="13"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 12 chips in the symmetric conditions than in the asymmetric information conditions (Kagel et al., 1996; Pillutla &amp; Murnighan, 1995; Straub &amp; Murnighan, 1995; Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000). An alternative possibility would be that participants in the asymmetric information condition are reluctant to ‘take advantage’ of their information advantage when being confronted with a happy opponent. In that case we should replicate the findings of Van Kleef et al. (2004a) in the symmetric information conditions (i.e., higher offers to the angry opponent than to the happy opponent), whereas in the asymmetric information conditions participants would offer more chips to the happy recipient than to the angry recipient.</region>

The fact that answers were sent to the opponent was explained by pointing out that in reality people often have some information about the other party. Participants then received the explanation of the ultimatum bargaining situation. All participants learned that they, X, would bargain with Y over the distribution of 100 chips; 1 chip was said to be worth 10 Euro cents to the allocator (person X) and 5 Euro cents to the recipient (person Y) (1 Euro equaled $1.20 at the time of the experiment). In all conditions, participants learned that they could make an offer for the distribution of the chips to the recipient. If the recipient would accept the offer, the chips would be divided accordingly. If the recipient rejected the offer, neither the recipient nor the allocator would receive any chips. In the asymmetric information conditions, participants were informed that the recipient did not know about the differential value, and that the recipient only knew that that chips were worth 5 cent to the recipient. In the symmetric information conditions participants learned that the recipient did know about the differential value of the chips. After explaining the bargaining situation, the manipulation of the recipient’s emotion was induced.

First, the independent variables (recipient’s emotion and information) should significantly affect the dependent variable (offer). Second, the independent variables should significantly affect the proposed mediator (perceived recipient’s limit). Third, to establish full mediation, the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable should become nonsignificant after controlling for the mediator. As our ANOVA findings on the offer already showed, the first condition was met by showing main effects for information and emotion (for information, β = -.37, p &lt; .0001; for emotion, β = -.23, p &lt; .01; R 2 = .19).

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="118" page="19" column="1">Emotions in Bargaining 18 For the current purposes, the more interesting finding concerns the effect of other’s emotion on offers. In this respect, our findings corroborated the basic reasoning of Van Kleef et al. (2004a, b) by showing that it pays to be angry in bargaining: Participants made higher offers to an angry recipient than to a happy recipient. Thus, even though bargainers seemed to reciprocate their opponent’s emotion in the sense that participants were more angry (and less happy) when confronted with an angry recipient, their anger did not translate into lower offers. In agreement with the social functional account of emotions, the results of the mediation analysis suggested that the process by which communicated emotions affected bargaining at least partly runs via perceived limits. Bargainers ascribed higher limits to angry opponents, and accommodated to these higher limits by offering them a better deal. It thus appeared that our current manipulation of emotion had similar effects as the emotion manipulation used by Van Kleef et al. (2004, a, b). Note that the giving in to an angry opponent was also observed in the asymmetric information conditions, and that we thus found a main effect of recipient’s emotion on offers. The data on the perceived limits and the mediation analysis show why: As in the symmetric information conditions, participants in the asymmetric information conditions expected higher limits from the angry recipient. From this, we may conclude that participants still feared that low offers were more likely to be rejected by angry opponents than by happy <marker type="page" number="20"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 19 In Experiment 2, we replicated the basic design of Experiment 1, such that participants were either confronted with an angry recipient or a happy recipient. And as in Experiment 1, chips were worth twice as much to the allocator as to the recipient, and information was manipulated as in Experiment 1. The main difference was that we changed the structure of the bargaining situation. We now allowed for additional communication by asking the participants to send a message to the recipient prior to making their offer. They could either (correctly) inform the recipient that chips were worth 10 cents to the allocator, or (incorrectly) inform them that chips were worth 5 cents to the allocator. With this added opportunity, participants could now actively deceive the recipient. Lewicki and Stark (1996, p. 78) defined deception as an activity that “manipulates the opponent’s logical and inferential processes, in order to lead the opponent to an incorrect conclusion or deduction.” Based on our social functional account of interpersonal emotions, and the apparent importance of the perceived limits for the offers, we reasoned that in this bargaining context deception will be used to affect the recipient’s limits. Of course, this added opportunity for information exchange should not have a strong impact on allocations in the symmetric information conditions, because there it would seem unlikely that participants would send incorrect information knowing that the recipient was fully aware of the value difference. Our main interest was in how participants in the asymmetric information<marker type="page" number="21"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 20 conditions would be especially likely to deceive the angry opponent, because deception offers the possibility to reduce the opponent’s limits. In previous research, Steinel and De Dreu (2004) have shown that people may be more likely to deceive others when they fear exploitation by these others, for instance if they expect that their opponent is competitive (see also Pruitt &amp; Kimmel, 1979; Rubin, Pruitt, &amp; Kim, 1994). In a similar vein, we expect people to be more likely to resort to deception if they anticipate that their opponent may have high limits. To assess whether people use deception to lower their opponent’s limits, we also assessed what limits the participants expected from their opponent after the information exchange. With regard to the offers, we anticipated that with the opportunity for deception, participants in the asymmetric information conditions would subsequently make lower offers to the angry recipient than to the happy recipient. After all, if participants would indeed be more deceitful towards the angry recipient in order to lower the recipient’s limits, they could subsequently make the recipient lower offers without having to fear that these would be rejected.</region>

Note, however, that an information advantage may also offer other opportunities: It may offer the opportunity to misinform others, for example by stating that chips are worth less to you than they actually are.

In addition to evidence suggesting that bargainers reciprocated their opponent’s emotions, the behavioral data showed that our participants were more deceptive towards angry bargainers. Fear of rejection appears to play a central role here. By deceiving the angry opponent, people may lower the limits of their opponent, which ‘allows’ them to make low offers without having to fear the consequences. Conversely, by</region>
        <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="212" page="28" column="1">truthfully informing the happy opponent about the value difference, bargainers put themselves in a situation that calls for compensation. This is not to say that the communicated emotion affects the interest that people have in making an offer that would be accepted by their opponent. As our data show, in the end, participants in all conditions seemed equally convinced that the recipient would accept their offer. Experiment 3: So you’re angry, and you may reject? Big deal.</outsider>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="215" page="29" column="1">Emotions in Bargaining 28 The results of Experiment 2 suggest that the participants strived to get their offers accepted, and that in their “getting to yes” (cf. Fisher &amp; Ury, 1981) they strategically tried to lower the limits of especially the angry opponent. It thus seems that in the pursuit of getting one’s offer accepted, people may turn to deception when confronted with anger. The recipient’s impact in the ultimatum game pertains to what would happen if he or she rejected the allocator’s offers. As we noted, in the typical ultimatum bargaining study, the consequences of rejection of the offer are high because rejection leaves the allocator empty- handed. In such a setting, allocators may (rightfully) fear the consequences of having their offer rejected. But what would happen if the consequences of the recipient’s rejection of the offer are less severe? What if outcomes can be secured even when hearing a “no?” As we mentioned in the general introduction, it is possible to manipulate the relative power position of allocator and recipient in the ultimatum bargaining context by varying the consequences of rejection. In the delta bargaining game, rejection of the offer means that the offer is multiplied with a factor delta (0 ≤ delta ≤ 1). With higher values of delta, the consequences of rejection become less severe (Suleiman, 1996; Van Dijk et al., 2004). An interesting implication is that when the consequences of rejection are low, one no longer has to fear an angry recipient’s reaction. Whereas it may still be true that anger communicates higher limits, the limit itself may thus become less essential in the bargaining process. Simply <marker type="page" number="30"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 29 In Experiment 3 we thus manipulated the consequences of rejection by manipulating delta, and again manipulated the communicated emotions of the recipient. Our main interest was to see whether, if the consequences of rejection were low, participants would make lower offers to the angry recipient than to the happy recipient. Because fear of rejection and perceived limits have played an important role in our reasoning thus far, we also measured these constructs.</region>
        <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="214" page="29" column="1">put, when the consequences of rejection are low, bargainers may reason that the communication of high limits via communicated anger is not worrying at all: Why even care about your limits if the consequences of your rejection of my offer are low? This also means that bargainers should be less focused on having their offers accepted, and thus that in contrast with Experiments 1 and 2, we should now find effects on the perceived acceptability of the offers.</outsider>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="279" confidence="possible" page="36" column="1">The results of Experiment 3 again suggest that communicating anger is not without risk. In the low consequences conditions, participants offered fewer chips to a recipient who communicated anger than to a recipient who communicated happiness. And again it appears that the consequences of rejection play an important role in shaping the effect of emotions on bargaining behavior. When the consequences of rejection were low, the participants appeared to be less bothered by the fact that the recipient might reject their offer. It is in this condition that communication of anger backfired, and led to lower offers. Moreover, as our mediation analyses showed, it appears that the process that can be held accountable for this adverse effect is that when the consequences of rejection are low, the participants ‘released’ their own anger by making low offers. It is also interesting to see that in contrast to Experiments 1 and 2, now our manipulations did affect the estimated likelihood of acceptance. As we stated in our introduction of Experiment 3, this finding is explained by the fact that we now manipulated the consequences of rejection. When the consequences of rejection are low, perceived acceptability of the offer becomes a less important determinant of bargaining behavior</region>
        <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="280" page="36" column="1">because high outcomes can be obtained even after rejection.

In particular, it has been argued that in situations of symmetry, equal division provides a strong anchor for decisions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="290" class="deo:Reference">Allison &amp; Messick, 1990</xref>; see also Messick, 1993, who talked about the attractiveness of the equal division rule). In situations of asymmetry, however, there may be more (normative) ambiguity on how to distribute outcomes.

        <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="292" page="37" column="1">lead to an unequal distribution of the money) but also that one should compensate for the asymmetric value of the chips (i.e., strive for an equal distribution of the money). The fact that there may be several interpretations as to what would be fair, may render the situation more ambiguous (see also Wade-Benzoni et al. 1996). Loewenstein and Moore (2003) were very explicit about this when applying this notion to bargaining.

In this respect, Loewenstein and Moore explicitly referred to asymmetry between parties, and noted that “if there is ambiguity in the situation that allows for alternative interpretations, motivations and expectations will have an effect.” (p. 41).

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="294" confidence="possible" page="38" column="1">symmetric information condition accords with this view. 3 General Discussion In agreement with the social functional account of emotions (see e.g., Keltner &amp; Haidt, 1999), the current findings show that emotions strongly shape the bargaining process. Previous research on the interpersonal effects of emotions basically suggested that it pays to be angry in bargaining (Sinaceur &amp; Tiedens, 2006; Van Kleef et al., 2004a, b). The current findings paint a more complex and differentiated picture of the emotion-behavior link in bargaining. The results underscore the importance of distinguishing between the informational effects and the behavioral effects of communicated emotions. The three studies show uniform effects when it comes to the informational consequences of communicating anger, but they differ with regard to the behavioral consequences. Whereas all three experiments suggested that people infer that angry bargainers have higher limits, the findings</region>
        <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="295" page="38" column="1">of Experiment 2 and 3 indicate that behavioral effects strongly depend on the structural characteristics of the bargaining situation. In particular, the results show that communicated anger may backfire if bargainers can deceive their angry opponent (Experiment 2), or if the consequences of rejection are reduced (Experiment 3). It should be noted that despite these insights, the current studies do not refute the basic reasoning underlying the analysis or previous theorizing on communicated emotions</outsider>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="300" page="39" column="1">Emotions in Bargaining 38 (e.g., Sinaceur &amp; Tiedens, 2006; Van Kleef et al., 2004a, b). In agreement with these previous studies, we too assign a central role to perceived limits in bargaining and the negative consequences that bargainers may ascribe to making low offers to angry opponents. Moreover, the results of Experiment 1 corroborate the findings and reasoning of such prior research. We obtained these findings by manipulating emotion independently from the offer. In this sense, our manipulation was different from the manipulations used in previous research where manipulated emotions were closely connected to the offers (e.g., Van Kleef et al., 2004a, b). In these studies, participants made an offer and then, for example, learned that their opponent reacted with anger to their offer (e.g., by communicating ‘this offer makes me really angry’). We decided to disentangle the offer from the communicated emotions by having the recipients (supposedly) respond to the general information participants typed about how they viewed bargaining in general. The advantage of this procedure is that it precludes the possibility that communicated anger is primarily an evaluation of the offer. As a consequence, it excludes the possibility that people decide to give in to an angry opponent because they conclude that apparently their opponent did not like the offer. With the alternative procedure we were able to show identical effects as Van Kleef et al. in our Experiment 1, thereby lending more credence to their basic reasoning. We extend and qualify previous findings, however, by explicitly distinguishing <marker type="page" number="40"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 39 bargaining literature, we suggest that people may actively try to lower the angry opponent’s limits by using deception as a strategic tool. In this respect, the current findings also add to the literature on deception in bargaining. It has been noted that the bargaining process is ripe with opportunities for deception (e.g., Bok, 1978; Boles, Croson, &amp; Murnighan, 2000; O’Connor &amp; Carnevale, 1997; Steinel &amp; De Dreu, 2004). Research on deception in bargaining is still in its embryonic phase, however, especially with regard to the antecedents of deception. Prior research on the use of deception in bargaining has predominantly taken an individual and instrumental perspective in the sense that people are assumed to be more likely to resort to deception the more likely it is that deception will bring them higher personal outcomes (e.g., Boles et al., 2000; Lewicki, 1983; Lewicki &amp; Litterer, 1985; O’Connor &amp; Carnevale, 1997; Tenbrunsel, 1998; see also Trevino &amp; Youngblood, 1990). On the one hand, the findings of Experiment 2 align with this framework because they suggest that people strategically use deception to lower the other’s limits. On the other hand, they illustrate that people do not indiscriminately turn to defection in the sense that they are more likely to refrain from deceiving the happy recipient, to the point where they even offered more chips to the happy recipient than to the angry recipient. This view of ‘tailored deception’ accords with more recent insights by Steinel and De Dreu (2004) who demonstrated that people are more willing to deceive<marker type="page" number="41"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 40 (symmetric vs. asymmetric). As we noted, this manipulation has been successfully used before, both in the way we used it in Experiment 1 (i.e., in which participants could only make an offer), and in Experiment 2 (i.e., where participants could also send information prior to making their offer). What our findings show is that effects of information advantage may be fundamentally different in situations where people can only make an offer than in situations where people can also send information prior to making their offer. That is, we did observe a significant interaction between emotion and information on the offers in Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1. As we reasoned, this difference was due to the fact that with a pre-offer sending of information bargainers may actively change the limits of their opponent. It appears that this active process is necessary for the emotion × information</region>
        <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="297" page="39" column="1">between the informational and behavioral consequences of communicated emotions, as well as pointing to the situational contingencies that govern and determine the behavioral implications of emotional expressions. We have demonstrated that expressions of anger versus happiness carry information that has consequences for the perceiver’s subsequent behavior. Moreover, these consequences depend on the structural characteristics of the bargaining situation. For example, building on previous insights derived from the ultimatum</outsider>
        <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="299" page="40" column="1">competitive opponents than cooperative opponents. It also accords with findings reported by Paese and Gilin (2000; see also Paese, Schreiber, &amp; Taylor, 2003), who found that “nice” behavior in bargaining, in the form of honest disclosure of own alternatives, increased negotiator’s willingness to share information and make concessions. At this point, it is interesting to further discuss the differences between the findings we obtained in Experiments 1 and 2 in which we varied the distribution of information</outsider>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="301" confidence="possible" page="41" column="1">interaction to emerge. Prior research has never acknowledged this difference. Of course this has much to do with the reason why these situations were studied in the first place. As we reasoned in our general introduction the main purpose of introducing asymmetry of information in research on ultimatum bargaining research has been to demonstrate that people often make high offers because they fear that low offers will be rejected. In this respect, both possibilities provide the opportunity to make lower offers, and as such both situations have primarily been regarded as evidence for the fear of rejection hypothesis (e.g., Pillutla &amp; Murnighan, 2003).</region>
        <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="footer" id="302" page="41" column="1">On the theoretical level, this means that in previous research a situation like that of Experiment 1 was not treated as being fundamentally different from a situation in which people could send information, and as such making low offers in both situations was mainly interpreted as strategic and self-interested behavior. The current findings corroborate this reasoning, but in addition show that the possibility of sending information offers new possibilities and behavioral effects that do not necessarily surface in a situation without</outsider>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="303" page="42" column="1">Emotions in Bargaining 41 exchange of information. Indeed, the findings of Experiment 2 show that people are especially likely to deceive an angry opponent. Put differently, it also means that with a happy opponent people do not want to go “all the way” to further their own outcomes. Thus, there are limits to the strategic means that people use to further their own outcomes, and these limits are partly shaped by interpersonal effects of emotions. With our Experiment 3 on delta bargaining we were also able to show that the interpersonal effects of emotions in bargaining may be contingent on the consequences of rejection. With regard to the theoretical analysis regarding emotion effects in bargaining, the findings suggest that when fear for rejection is low, communicating anger may backfire. At this point it seems appropriate to elaborate some more on the difference in processes leading up to the findings we reported in Experiments 2 and 3. Whereas both studies suggest that communicating anger may backfire, and both studies assign a crucial role to fear of rejection, it should be noted that the underlying process is fundamentally different for Experiments 2 and 3. Note that in Experiment 2, our deception study, the process is essentially based on the notion that in all conditions, participants fear the consequences of having their offers rejected, and that deception offers bargainers the possibility to reach acceptance of low</region>

In Experiment 3, the likelihood ratings were especially low when consequences of rejection were low and the recipient was angry. Another way of putting it is that in Experiment 3, the participants’ anger could find its way to the person responsible for their anger, the angry recipient. As we demonstrated, communicated anger also backfired in Experiment 2, when the participants had an information advantage and could deceive the recipient. Our mediation analysis indicated that in that experiment, the offers were mediated by the perceived limits, which fits with the notion that if the consequences of rejection are high, people primarily let their decisions be influenced by the limits they assign to their opponent. One might wonder, however, whether the process might also run via the participants’ emotions, as it did in Experiment 3. We did check for this possibility by testing for moderated mediation along the lines of Experiment 3. This analysis indicated that the offers in Experiment 2 were not mediated by the participants’ emotion (neither anger, nor happiness). It thus seems that, if the consequences of rejection are high, the bargainers’ first interest is to deal with their opponent’s limits, and not to act on their own emotions. If, however, the consequences of rejection are low, the own emotions come into play. As such, our findings also constitute first evidence for the possibility that the reciprocity of emotions (Hatfield et al., 1994; Van Kleef et al., 2004a) in bargaining contexts <marker type="page" number="44"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 43 context, expressions of anger appear to be a powerful strategy for claiming value.” The current findings argue against such a general advice, as it is hard to imagine a negotiation setting that would be even shorter than the ultimatum bargaining settings we used. The advantage of concentrating on ultimatum bargaining was that it constitutes a clear bargaining setting with a clear outcome structure, in which many dynamics due to making offers and counteroffers are kept out of the picture. Thanks to this inherent simplicity, we were able to provide clear findings and conclusions regarding interpersonal effects of emotions. In future research, it may also be interesting to broaden the scope by also including other determinants of the power/dependency relation between bargainers, such as the number and attractiveness of the alternatives that allocators and recipients have at their disposal. Bargainers are less dependent on their opponent the more and the higher their alternatives are (e.g., Fisher &amp; Ury, 1981, Pinkley, 1995). If we would include this in our current ultimatum paradigms, it seems likely that communicating anger is especially detrimental when one’s opponent has a high alternative and/or many alternatives. An alternative course would be to see how our findings generalize to other types of bargaining. For example, it may be especially worthwhile to expand the view by also addressing integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining, bargainers may generate integrative potential (i.e., realize a win-win situation; Fisher &amp; Ury, 1981) if they disclose<marker type="page" number="45"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 44 do more than ‘just’ backfire to the person communicating the anger. It might prove to be detrimental for all people involved if it keeps the bargainers from realizing the integrative potential (see also Allred, Mallozzi, Matsui, &amp; Raia, 1997; Barry, Fulmer, &amp; Van Kleef, 2004; Forgas, 1998), and communicating happiness may be more beneficial for all parties involved (Carnevale &amp; Isen, 1986; Moore, Kurtzberg, Thompson, &amp; Morris, 1999). To conclude, the current studies underscore the importance of the interpersonal effects of communicated emotions. In contrast to previous research, this does not result in a simple “what-to-do-in-bargaining” advice that can be applied no matter what. What it does show, is that one should think well before following up on the advice that communicating anger pays. Before doing so, be sure to assess the structural characteristics of the bargaining situation in terms of the consequences of rejecting offers, and the possibilities for deception.<marker type="page" number="46"/><marker type="block"/> Emotions in Bargaining 45 Footnotes 1. In terms of the formal description of the delta game (Suleiman, 1996; Van Dijk et al., 2004), this means that in the high consequences conditions, delta was set at 0, and that in the low consequences conditions, delta was set at 0.9. 2.

Prior theorizing on communicated emotions did acknowledge the possibility of detrimental effects due to reciprocated emotions, but the lack of behavioral effects has led researchers to conclude that its influence might be limited, especially in the short term. For example, Sinaceur and Tiedens (2006, p. 321) concluded that “the expression of anger may be a strategy best suited for relatively short single-shot negotiations. But in that</outsider>

Based on the current findings, we suggest that communicated emotions may distort this process, and in particular that bargainers may be less willing to display their true preferences to an angry opponent. In our studies, the concealment of true preferences (and the sending of incorrect information) was used to promote the own outcomes. In the context of integrative bargaining, however, such a deceptive strategy might be counterproductive. As such, communicated anger might</outsider>

Apparently, and in agreement with the ascribed importance to anger in bargaining, anger played a more crucial role in explaining offers than happiness. 3. We did not check for this possibility, but some indirect support for the post hoc explanation comes from inspection of the standard deviations in the symmetric information conditions of Experiments 1 and 2, and the high consequences condition of Experiment 3. As this comparison shows, standard deviations were smaller in Experiment 3, which would fit with the notion that leeway was more restricted there. We are of course aware that this is a post hoc explanation with indirect empirical support, but it may be interesting to note that previous studies that allow for a similar comparison reveal a similar pattern.
