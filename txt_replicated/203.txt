Categorical perception (CP) is said to occur when a continuum of equally spaced physical
changes is perceived as unequally spaced as a function of category membership (Harnad,
S. (Ed.) (1987). Psychophysical and cognitive aspects of categorical perception: A critical
overview. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). A common suggestion is that CP for
color arises because perception is qualitatively distorted when we learn to categorize a
dimension. Contrary to this view, we here report that English speakers show no evidence
of lowered discrimination thresholds at the boundaries between blue and green categories
even though CP is found at these boundaries in a supra-threshold task. Furthermore, there
is no evidence of different discrimination thresholds between individuals from two language groups (English and Korean) who use different color terminology in the blue–green
region and have different supra-threshold boundaries. Our participants’ just noticeable difference (JND) thresholds suggest that they retain a smooth continuum of perceptual space
that is not warped by stretching at category boundaries or by within-category compression. At least for the domain of color, categorical perception appears to be a categorical,
but not a perceptual phenomenon.

1. Introduction
Categorical perception (CP) for color is manifest as more
accurate or more rapid discrimination of pairs of colors
that belong to different color categories compared to
equally separated members of the same category (when
equated in a smooth perceptual metric such as C.I.E.
L*u*v* space. For example, participants can detect a difference between a blue target and green distractors more
quickly than they can detect a difference between targets
and distractors that belong to the same color category
(e.g. different shades of blue). They also show faster peak
ERP latencies for between- compared to within-category
color differences (Fonteneau & Davidoff, 2007), which suggests that categorization takes place within 100 ms and before visual analysis is complete. One explanation of CP is

that our perception is warped so that an otherwise smooth
continuum of change becomes ‘stretched’ at category
boundaries and ‘compressed’ in category centers (Harnad,
1987; Notman, Sowden, & Ozgen, 2005; Özgen & Davies,
2002; Thierry, Athanasopoulos, Wiggett, Dering, & Kuipers,
2009). In principle, such perceptual inequality might arise
from the innate structure of human color vision. However
adult speakers of languages that employ fewer (e.g. Berinmo, Himba) or more (e.g. Russian, Korean, Greek) basic
color categories than English show CP in different areas
of color space from speakers of English (Athanasopoulos,
2009; Davidoff, Davies, & Roberson, 1999; Roberson,
Davidoff, Davies, & Shapiro, 2005; Roberson, Pak, & Hanley,
2008; Winawer et al., 2007). It would therefore follow that
any perceptual inequality that exists for these individuals
must arise because category learning leads to changes in
perceptual systems. Such changes would involve relatively
long-term tuning at a receptor level rather than short-term
adaptation, attentional shifts, or changes in strategic focus
(Goldstone, 1998). If this is true, then it should be possible

D. Roberson et al. / Cognition 112 (2009) 482–487

to discriminate just noticeable differences (JNDs) between
shades of color more readily at boundaries between color
categories than in category centers.
Nevertheless, some evidence rests uneasily alongside
claims that CP for color is caused by perceptual warping.
CP for color is not observed when naming is prevented
by a secondary verbal task (Gilbert, Regier, Kay, & Ivry,
2006; Roberson & Davidoff, 2000; Winawer et al., 2007).
Furthermore, when targets are presented either to the left
or right of a central ﬁxation point, color CP is observed in
the right visual ﬁeld (RVF) but not the left (Drivonikou
et al., 2007; Roberson et al., 2008). Such hemispheric
asymmetry has been shown for English speakers at the
boundary between blue and green (Gilbert et al., 2006),
and for Korean speakers for a boundary that is marked in
Korean, but not in English (Roberson et al., 2008). The
asymmetry seems to occur because stimuli presented in
the RVF have preferential access to language processing
areas in the left hemisphere. Further evidence comes from
the ﬁnding of the asymmetry in a split-brain patient, for
whom information about stimuli presented in the left visual ﬁeld could not reach the left hemisphere (Gilbert
et al., 2006). Moreover, recent evidence shows differential
activation of brain areas involved in language processing
during early perceptual processing of color (Tan et al.,
2008).
These ﬁndings raise the possibility that CP for color is
mediated by higher-level cognitive processes rather than
by perceptual warping, and only occurs when a linguistic
code is accessed. According to this view, CP occurs because
colored stimuli from different color categories are represented as separate terms (e.g. blue vs. green) in a verbal
code. Consequently, they can be distinguished rapidly because both verbal and perceptual codes provide converging
evidence that they are different. Two different shades of
the same color category will be distinguished more slowly
because they will activate the same verbal label, which will
conﬂict with the perceptual information that they are different (Roberson & Hanley, 2007; Roberson et al., 2008).
According to this view, while CP should be observed on supra-threshold tasks, it will not be observed on a task that
involves discrimination of JNDs because its performance
is unlikely to be affected by activation of a verbal code.
As a direct test of the perceptual warping hypothesis,
the present study compares JND discrimination thresholds
(the smallest difference in shade that can be reliably discriminated) in speakers of English and Korean. We used a
range of colors that English speakers divide into two categories (green and blue) but Korean speakers divide into
three basic categories: chorok, cheongnok and parang
(Kim, Pak, & Lee, 2001; Lee et al., 2003).1 CP for this range
of stimuli has previously been demonstrated in English
speakers for a wide range of supra-threshold perceptual
and memory judgments (Bornstein & Korda, 1984; Pilling,
Wiggett, Özgen, & Davies, 2003; Roberson & Davidoff,
2000; Wiggett & Davies, 2008). We chose to use the ZEST

algorithm (King-Smith, Grigsby, Vingrys, Benes, & Supowit,
1994) because it avoids the problems associated with traditional adaptive staircase methods that systematically increase or decrease the difference being measured. In those
methods participants can anticipate the mechanics of the
staircase. This is not possible with the ZEST algorithm, which
is not systematic in its increments or reductions of color
separations. We also compare the performance of Korean
and English speakers on a supra-threshold same-different
judgment task (Experiment 2). If learning the appropriate
set of categories warps perceptual space, then discrimination thresholds should be lower at the boundary between
an individual’s named categories than in the category centers. These lowered thresholds should be found at those
boundaries for which CP is found in supra-threshold tasks.
There should also be group differences between English
and Korean speakers relating to the number of categories
used and the location of category boundaries.

2. Experiment 1 – discrimination thresholds
To test discrimination thresholds, eight monolingual
native English speakers (tested in Colchester, UK) and eight
native Korean speakers (tested in Seoul, Korea) carried out
an edge-detection task for patches of color presented on a
computer screen in a dark room (luminance less than
0.001 cd/m2). All participants were tested in their native
language and had no knowledge of color terms in the other
language. All had normal color vision as assessed by the
Ishihara (1992) and City Color Vision (Fletcher, 1980) tests.
Two adjacent rectangular patches of color appeared in the
centre of the screen on a neutral grey background, forming
a rectangular patch of which 2/3 was one shade and the
other 1/3 a slightly different shade. The ‘edge’ between
two adjacent patches of color was blurred with a 6 pixel
wide Gaussian blur and could be reliably detected only if
the two shades could be discriminated. Participants were
asked to estimate whether a line (edge) appeared towards
the left or right side of the patch.
Using the ZEST algorithm (King-Smith et al., 1994) participants’ JND thresholds were estimated in CIE (1976,
L*u*v*) DE units for each of 15 points (linearly spaced in
the perceptual metric) ranging from the centre of the
green/chorok category, across the boundary between green
and blue for English speakers, or across the boundaries between chorok/cheongnok/parang to the centre of the blue/
parang category for Korean speakers. These points were derived from Munsell colors, for which previous experiments
have established the boundary for each of the above categories and maintained lightness (Munsell Value = 5.47)
and saturation (Munsell Chroma = 7.03) constant, so they
varied only in hue. They were converted to L*u*v* (Appendix I) and implemented using the CRS VISage 11/3 protocol
on a Mitsubishi, Diamond Pro 2070, 22” CRT monitor (set
to gamma – 2.2, color temperature – 6500 K, luminance –
100 cd/m2). Color patches measured 7.5 cm  15.5 cm
and were viewed from approx. 60 cm at eye-level.
Luminance values varied minimally across the range (less
than 10% DE). The resolution and reproduction frequency
of the monitor were 1024  768 pixels and 85 Hz,

484

respectively and stimulus measurements were veriﬁed
with a CRS ColorCal colorimeter. Using ZEST procedures,
there were three interleaved runs in each cycle, each for
one of the 15 target locations, with initial offset of ±.055
DE. Across trials the separation between target and distractor stimuli varied between .09 and .02 DE. Thresholds were
bi-directionally measured around each point. Stimuli remained on screen for 1000 ms or until a response was
made. The complete set of 5 cycles was presented twice
in random order and the combination of points for which

thresholds were measured in each cycle was randomized
across participants so that thresholds were measured for
each point in random order. For each stimulus the position
of the target (left or right) and the fraction of the total
patch it occupied (2/3 or 1/3) were randomly varied across
trials and across comparison stimuli. Total testing time
averaged 1 h. After testing, each participant named each
of the 15 stimuli for which thresholds had been measured.
To control for any effects of the lengthy threshold
measurement task on naming, participants returned to

the laboratory after a two-week interval and named the
stimuli again. Comparisons were ﬁrst made for each participant between thresholds for shades that were central to
each of their own named categories and for shades that
were on the boundary between their named categories.
Subsequently, group comparisons were made between languages for thresholds at the English boundary and at the
two Korean boundaries. Fig. 1 shows mean naming boundaries averaged across the two naming sessions for English
speakers (a), Korean speakers (b) and mean threshold measurements across the range of stimuli for English and Korean speakers (c).
A 2: language (Korean vs. English)  2: stimulus type
(Within-category vs. Boundary) ANOVA with repeated
measures over the second factor revealed no signiﬁcant
difference in discrimination sensitivity for boundary relative to within-category stimuli for either population
[F(1,14) < 1], no signiﬁcant difference in sensitivity between
speakers of the two languages [F(1,14) = 1.68, p > .1] and no
interaction [F(1,14) = 1.69, p > .1]. Due to the properties of
the monitor there were minor perturbations in the differences of thresholds tested so that not all DE differences between a target and its nearest neighbors were exactly
identical (maximum perturbation = 0.007 DE). These differences were extremely small and could not have affected
the result, since the largest differences were measured for
the boundary stimuli 7.5BG and 8.5BG. Had this marginally
greater distance resulted in easier discrimination, we
should have observed a reduced threshold at this boundary, but we did not. However, an additional control analysis compared thresholds at 3.7BG and 6.25BG (withincategory green and blue, respectively) with thresholds at
7.5BG and 8.75BG (cross-category) for which differences
from closest comparison stimuli were identical (0.02 DE).
The ANOVA revealed no signiﬁcant effect of language
[F(1,14) = 2.03, MSE = 1.91, p > .1], no signiﬁcant effect of
pair type [F(1,14) < 1] and no signiﬁcant interaction
[F(1,14) < 1]. Finally, we compared performance for English
and Korean speakers at the English boundary (7.5BG),
and at the 2 Korean boundaries (10BG and 3.75BG). There
was no signiﬁcant difference between the two populations

485

for any of the measured points (Bonferroni t(14) = .331, 1.77
and 1.57, respectively, all p > .05) although there was a
slight trend for Korean speakers to have lower thresholds
than English speakers for the two Korean boundaries. No
participants showed a signiﬁcantly reduced discrimination
threshold at the category boundary, in an edge-detection
task that should not involve color naming.
The results clearly show no systematic differences in
discriminative sensitivity at the boundaries between English color categories or between speakers of Korean and
English at category boundaries that exist in Korean but
not English. To conﬁrm that both English and Korean
speakers show CP at these boundaries in supra-threshold
tasks, Experiment 2 compared same-different judgments
for the 15 stimuli for which thresholds were measured in
Experiment 1.
3. Experiment 2
From the 15 target stimuli in Experiment 1, within- or
across-category pairs of equally separated colors were created and matched with an equal number of pairs of identical stimuli. Twenty native English speakers (7 males, 13
females, mean age = 22.3) from the University of Essex
and 20 native Korean speakers (9 males, 11 females, mean
age = 25.7) from higher-education institutions in Seoul, all
with normal color vision made same-different judgments
for these pairs of stimuli. None had taken part in Experiment 1. Equally spaced pairs of stimuli were constructed
so that pairs 5BG/7.5BG and 6.25BG/8.25BG were withincategory for Korean speakers but cross-category for English
speakers. Pairs 10BG/2.5B and 8.25BG/1.25B were crosscategory for Korean speakers but within-category for English speakers. Pair 3.75BG/6.25BG was cross-category for
speakers of both languages and pair 5B/7.5B was withincategory for speakers of both languages. Each of the stimuli
used in ‘different’ pairs also appeared paired with an identical patch as a ‘same’ pair. The 6 ‘different’ pairs appeared
twice, with each stimulus appearing once on the left and
once on the right. Each block thus had 12 ‘same’ and 12
‘different’ pairs. There were 4 blocks of trials with stimulus

pairs randomized within each block, making a total of 96
trials. Participants completed 8 initial practice trials with
colors not included in the subsequent experiment. Color
patches measured 5 cm  5 cm, separated by 1.5 cm and
were viewed from approx. 60 cm at eye-level in the centre
of a neutral grey screen (properties of the screen given for
Experiment 1). Stimuli were generated using the CRS VISage system and the same monitor as Experiment 1. Following a ﬁxation cross for 700 ms, pairs of stimuli were
presented for 350 ms, followed by a 750 ms ISI. Participants indicated whether the two patches were ‘identical’
or ‘different’ shades by key press.
The proportion of correct ‘different’ judgments was
compared across languages in a 2 (Language: English vs.
Korean)  4 (Pair type: within-category in both languages
vs. within-category in English vs. cross-category in English
vs. cross-category in both languages) ANOVA with repeated measures over the second factor. There was no signiﬁcant effect of language [F(1,38) = 1.07, MSE = .01, p > .1]
and no signiﬁcant effect of pair type [F(3,114) = 1.63,
MSE = .01, p > .1] but a signiﬁcant interaction [F(3,114) =
7.75, MSE = .01, p < .01]. Newman–Keuls pairwise comparisons of the interaction showed a signiﬁcant effect of Language for pairs that were within-category in English
(cross-category in Korean) and cross-category in English
(within-category in Korean) (both p < .01) but no difference for the other two pair types. English speakers showed
signiﬁcantly better discrimination for both types of crosscategory pairs than for either type of within-category pair
(both p < .05). Korean speakers, however, showed signiﬁcantly better discrimination of pairs that were within-category in English than pairs that were cross-category in
English (p < .05). Fig. 2 illustrates these results.
For each language, pairs of colors that crossed the category boundary were discriminated more accurately than
pairs of colors from within the same category, even though
the boundaries differed across languages.
These ﬁndings support the ﬁndings of Roberson et al.
(2008) for the Korean category boundary between yeondu
(yellow–green) and chorok (green), which lies fully within
the green category for English speakers. Roberson et al.
(2008) suggested that the differential CP effect observed
in speakers of different languages arise as a result of conﬂict for within-category decisions between access to the
category label (which indicates that two stimuli are the
same) and access to the visual information that they are
different. Resolving these two conﬂicting sources of information leads to more error–prone performance than for
cross-category pairs, where both the category label and
the visual information indicate that the two stimuli are
different.

4. General discussion
In Experiment 2 all participants showed CP for the
boundaries marked in their own language, with more accurate discrimination of cross- than within-category decisions. This could not have been the result of any
perceptual inequality between pairs of stimuli, because
the pattern of performance differed across language

groups. In Experiment 1, by contrast, neither English nor
Korean participants showed lowered perceptual thresholds
at the boundary between their named categories. The data
strongly suggest that learning to categorize colors does not
‘warp’ color perception and that CP for color does not result from such perceptual warping.
In supra-threshold tasks, such as simultaneous samedifferent judgments, within- and cross-category discriminations might be equivalent because performance for both
types of stimuli is at ceiling. This cannot be the case in
Experiment 1. All participants do show variability in their
discrimination thresholds across the range of stimuli
tested. However this variation is not systematic and does
not yield lower thresholds at individual named category
boundaries. We conclude that, at least at the very ﬁnely
graded level of Just Noticeable Differences, color space is
perceptually uniform.
In an edge-detection task such as the present one,
where the difference between the two shades is at the level
of a JND, verbal labels would not aid discrimination.
Although the whole series progresses from green to blue
(for English speakers), the difference between any two
stimuli is so small that they would not reliably be called
by different names (see Roberson, Davidoff, & Braisby
(1999) for a discussion of this issue). Unlike the same-different task used in Experiment 2 in which color CP was
demonstrated, the threshold task does not require overt
comparison of differences or similarities between colors.
It therefore appears that the category advantage termed
CP only occurs in tasks that involve activation of verbal categories or linguistic codes. When naming is of no beneﬁt,
as in the present task, or where it is prevented by verbal
interference or by LVF presentation, there is evidence of a
smooth continuum of change across the color spectrum.
In other domains where novices are trained to discriminate previously indistinguishable visual stimuli, it is possible that the development of expertise entails tuning at
a more perceptual level. For example, improvement in
some visual discriminations, such as the motion of a random dot ﬁeld is associated with signiﬁcant changes in
the response characteristics of individual cells in parietal
(Zohary, Celbrini, Britten, & Newsome, 1994) or primary visual cortex (Fahle & Morgan, 1996). Also, participants
trained on a Vernier line-discrimination task eventually
showed acuity greater than that of individual photoreceptors (Poggio, Fahle, & Edelman, 1992). Perceptual learning
is implicated in these domains because the effects are evident at early stages of processing and are often restricted
to the trained stimulus orientation (Notman et al., 2005),
or even to a speciﬁc retinal location (Fahle, Edelman, &
Poggio, 1995).
However, this does not appear to be the case where color categorization is concerned. In the case of color, humans
may already have hyper-acuity (Chuchland & Sejnowski,
1994), so that no further ‘tuning’ occurs with category
learning. Indeed, thresholds for color discrimination have
been reported to be remarkably robust in some patient
populations, despite a variety of other visual deﬁcits
including reduced sensitivity to ﬂicker and reduced contrast sensitivity (Regan, Freudenthaler, Kolle, Mollon, &
Paulus, 1998). With regard to the color domain, we believe

D. Roberson et al. / Cognition 112 (2009) 482–487

that ‘‘categorical perception” is categorical but not perceptual, and should rather be referred to simply as a category
effect.
