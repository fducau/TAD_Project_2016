Mental imagery is thought to share properties with perception. To what extent does the
process of imagining a scene share neural circuits and computational mechanisms with
actually perceiving the same scene? Here, we investigated whether mental imagery of
motion in a particular direction recruits neural circuits tuned to the same direction of perceptual motion. To address this question we made use of a visual illusion, the motion aftereffect. We found that following prolonged imagery of motion in one direction, people are
more likely to perceive real motion test probes as moving in the direction opposite to the
direction of motion imagery. The transfer of adaptation from imagined to perceived motion
provides evidence that motion imagery and motion perception recruit shared directionselective neural circuitry. Even in the absence of any visual stimuli, people can selectively
recruit speciﬁc low-level sensory neurons through mental imagery.

1. Introduction
The mechanisms underlying mental imagery have been
investigated for over a century. One important question
has been whether imagery uses the same mechanisms normally employed for perception (Ishai & Sagi, 1995; Kosslyn, Thompson, & Alpert, 1997; Perky, 1910; Pylyshyn,
2002). A number of brain areas important for perception
can also be engaged by imagery, including retinotopically
mapped regions in visual cortex (Kosslyn et al., 1999; Kosslyn, Thompson, Kim, & Alpert, 1995; Slotnick, Thompson, &
Kosslyn, 2005) and cortical areas that respond preferentially to speciﬁc classes of stimuli (e.g., faces, buildings)
(O’Craven and Kanwisher, 2000) or visual motion (Goebel,
Khorram-Sefat, Muckli, Hacker, & Singer, 1998; Grossman
& Blake, 2001). However, standard neuroimaging methods
have not answered whether the same subpopulations of
neurons are engaged by both perception and imagery.
Observations that a particular brain area is active during
either viewing or imagery of a particular feature does not

necessarily imply that the same individual neurons or ﬁne
circuits underlie these activations, nor whether the processing is selective for a particular feature; the activation
may be driven by a non-selective mechanism like arousal
or attention (Beauchamp, Cox, & DeYoe, 1997; Corbetta,
Miezin, Dobmeyer, Shulman, & Petersen, 1991; Huk, Ress,
& Heeger, 2001; O’Craven et al., 1997; Saenz, Buracas, &
Boynton, 2002).
To infer whether imagery of motion relies on directionselective motion circuitry that is also used for perception
of physical motion, we tested for a motion aftereffect following motion imagery. The motion aftereffect is an illusion in which after prolonged viewing of motion in one
direction, a stationary or ambiguous dynamic test stimulus
appears to drift in the opposite direction (Mather, Verstraten, & Anstis, 1998; Wohlgemuth, 1911). Prolonged viewing of directional motion is thought to adapt directionselective cortical neurons, such that subpopulations tuned
to the adapting direction become less responsive after
adaptation. Such direction-selective adaptation leads to
an imbalance in neural responses that favors the direction
opposite that of adaptation (Barlow & Hill, 1963). The presence of a motion aftereffect is therefore an indicator of the

involvement of direction-selective neural mechanisms
(Kohn & Movshon, 2003; Petersen, Baker, & Allman,
1985; Van Wezel & Britten, 2002).
We reasoned that if visual imagery of motion relies on
direction-selective neurons that are also involved in the
perception of physical motion, then prolonged imagery of
motion in one direction should adapt direction-selective
neurons and produce a motion aftereffect. In previous
work we have shown that viewing frozen-motion photographs can produce a motion aftereffect (Winawer, Huk,
& Boroditsky, 2008). Here we asked whether imagining
motion in the absence of visual stimuli can adapt direction-selective neurons and produce a motion aftereffect.
2. Methods
Five experiments were conducted. Experiments 1–3
tested for a motion aftereffect resulting from imagined motion. For comparison to the imagery experiments, Experiments 4 and 5 tested for a motion aftereffect resulting
from viewing real motion. Each experiment was preceded
by a baseline motion sensitivity measurement. In the
experimental trials, participants either imagined or viewed
motion, and were tested with moving-dot test probes. The
test probes were used to assess the degree to which imagining or viewing real motion caused a motion aftereffect.
2.1. Participants
Naïve volunteers from the MIT (n = 64) and Stanford
(n = 68) communities received course credit or were paid
for participation. In Experiment 1, 33 participants imagined upward or downward motion. In Experiment 2, 31
participants imagined inward or outward motion. In
Experiment 3, 30 participants also imagined inward or outward motion, but with a delay of 1, 4, or 13 s inserted in
each trial before the appearance of the test probe to assess
the decay of the aftereffect. In Experiments 4 and 5, participants passively viewed moving gratings, either upward or
downward (n = 31), or inward or outward (n = 7). In all
experiments, participants viewed or imagined the two
opposing directions of motion in separate blocks; no participants participated in more than one experiment.

according to their performance on the baseline motion discrimination task. Participants who failed to demonstrate
sensitivity to motion in the baseline task were excluded
from analysis (see Appendix A).

3. Imagery adaptation
Experiments 1 and 2 tested for adaptation from motion
imagery (Fig. 1). After a baseline task, participants were
familiarized with the motion stimuli to imagine. The stimuli were either horizontal gratings that moved up or down
(Experiment 1), or two vertical gratings that moved horizontally inward or outward (Experiment 2). The gratings
were square wave luminance gratings with a spatial frequency of 1 cycle per degree, and a speed of 2.7° per second. To facilitate imagery, participants were presented
with a timing guide: a stationary ﬁxation square which
cycled in luminance or a tone which cycled in pitch. The
timing guide cycled at the same temporal frequency as
the moving gratings. Participants viewed two examples
of the moving gratings in each direction for 6 s each, together with the ﬁxation square and tone. Participants were
told to ‘‘try to attend to the size, color, and speed of the
stripes, so that later you can picture them clearly even
when the screen is blank.” At the beginning of each of
the 8 imagery blocks, participants were re-familiarized
with the gratings by again viewing two examples of gratings in each direction in random order (6 s each). Participants were not told which direction of motion they
would need to imagine until after the re-familiarization.
This prevented them from being able to selectively attend
to the example gratings moving in the direction of imagery
for the subsequent block.
Each trial consisted of a period of imagery adaptation
followed by viewing a real moving-dot test stimulus. The
imagery adaptation period was 60 s in the ﬁrst trial of each
block and 6 s in each subsequent trial. After viewing the
moving-dot test stimulus participants indicated its direction with a keypress. Within each block of trials, the direction of imagery and whether the eyes were open or closed
was the same. For each direction of imagery adaptation,
there were two eyes-open blocks and two eyes-closed
blocks, in random order.

2.2. Moving-dot test stimuli
We assessed adaptation to motion with a standard
direction discrimination task (Newsome & Pare, 1988)
used previously to quantify motion aftereffects from
adapting to real visual motion (Blake & Hiris, 1993; Hiris
& Blake, 1992). The test stimulus consisted of low-contrast
dynamic random dots. The percentage of dots moving
coherently in a particular direction (‘‘motion coherence”)
varied from trial to trial. The direction of coherent motion
was either up/down (Experiments 1 and 4), or inward/outward (Experiments 2, 3, and 5). Participants were instructed to indicate the direction of global motion by
forced choice (up vs. down or inward vs. outward, depending on the type of motion in the experiment). The range of
motion coherence values was adjusted for each participant

4. Decay of imagery adaptation
Experiment 3 was conducted to assess whether aftereffects from mental imagery decay over a period of a few
seconds, as do aftereffects from visual motion (Keck &
Pentz, 1977). This experiment was identical to Experiment
2 except there was a variable delay (1, 4, or 13 s) between
when participants were cued to open their eyes following
imagery and when the test probe appeared; there was no
eyes-open condition; there were 8 dot coherence values
tested instead of 12; and there were two blocks of trials instead of 8, with each block consisting of 48 instead of 24
trials (2 directions for the test probe  8 coherence values  3 delay durations).

Fig. 1. Experimental procedure. Prior to each imagery block participants viewed four examples of moving gratings. The direction of imagery (up vs. down or
in vs. out) and whether the eyes were open or closed were the same throughout the block. Each trial within a block consisted of motion imagery followed by
a test stimulus. An imagery trial began with the appearance of a static grating and a small arrow indicating the direction of motion imagery for that block.
The grating and arrow then faded. On eyes-open trials, the participant then imagined motion (60 s for the ﬁrst trial of a block, 6 s for each subsequent ‘‘topup” adaptation trial) on a screen that was blank except for the ﬁxation timing guide. During the eyes-closed blocks, participants were instructed to close
their eyes each time the static grating faded and imagine motion while listening to the auditory timing guide. At the end of each imagery period, the tone
stopped cycling, and was followed by a pause and a beep, cueing participants to open their eyes and attend to the moving-dot test stimulus. The test
stimulus appeared 1 s after the beep cueing the end of the imagery period. For Experiment 3, the ﬁxation period between imagined motion and test
stimulus varied in duration. For control experiments with real motion, the grating did not fade; participants were instructed to passively view the moving
grating while ﬁxating the central square.

5. Real motion adaptation
In Experiments 4 and 5, we tested adaptation to real visual motion. The procedure and stimuli were identical to
those in Experiments 1 and 2 (up/down and in/out motion
adaptation, respectively) except that rather than being instructed to imagine motion during adaptation, participants
were simply instructed to ﬁxate on the actual moving grating; examples of the moving gratings were not shown at
the beginning of each block because participants did not
need to imagine the grating; there were four blocks of trials instead of eight because there were no eyes-closed
blocks; and there was no auditory timing guide.
6. Results
Imagery of motion produced motion aftereffects. Imagining motion upward made participants more likely to see
the test dots as moving downward, compared to imagining
motion downward. Likewise, imagining motion outward
made participants more likely to see the test dots as moving inward. These effects were found from imagery both
with eyes closed and with eyes open. Moreover, the effects
of imagery adaptation weakened when a delay was introduced between adaptation and test, as has been found

for perceptual motion adaptation (Keck & Pentz, 1977).
We infer that visual motion imagery involves some of the
same directional-selective motion processing circuits that
are used for perception of motion. Below, the motion aftereffects are quantiﬁed and compared to aftereffects from
perception of real motion.
6.1. Analysis
Fig. 2 shows the population motion sensitivity curves
following opposite directions of imagery adaptation. In
each plot, the vertical separation between the curves indicates how differently the same physical stimulus was
judged following imagery in opposite directions. The horizontal separation indicates the amount by which two stimuli that were judged by participants as the same (following
adaptation in different directions) were in fact physically
different. Had there been no effect of imagery the two
curves would overlap. If participants had answered based
on an association (e.g., with a bias to respond upwards following upwards imagery) then the difference between the
curves would have been in the opposite direction than
what we observed.
The motion aftereffects were quantiﬁed as the separation between the paired functions, estimated by logistic

Fig. 2. Aftereffects following motion imagery. The separation between population motion sensitivity curves indicates that participants were more likely to
perceive motion of the test stimulus in the direction opposite imagery, evidence for a motion aftereffect from motion imagery. Data points represent the
mean frequency of responding upward (Experiment 1, upper panels) or inward (Experiment 2, lower panels) either with the eyes closed (left) or eyes open
(right). Error bars are one SEM by participant. The x-axis is the motion coherence in normalized units. Positive numbers are arbitrarily assigned to upward
or inward motion. The curves are logistic regressions ﬁtted to the population data (see Appendix A). The separation between the ﬁtted functions, in units of
normalized coherence, is 0.13, 0.06, 0.14, and 0.08 for up/down imagery with eyes open, up/down imagery with eyes closed, in/out imagery with eyes open,
and in/out imagery with eyes closed, respectively. For each of these parameter estimates, the lower bound was above 0: 0.10, 0.05, 0.05, and 0.03,
respectively (95% conﬁdence intervals).

ﬁts to the population data (Fig. 2; see Appendix A for model ﬁts).
The aftereffects were further quantiﬁed on individual
participants. A logistic regression was ﬁt to each participant’s data. This provided for each participant an estimate of the separation between the two curves (up vs.
down or inward vs. outward) for each eye condition
(open and closed). We coded this value as positive if
the separation between the curves was in the direction
predicted by an aftereffect and negative if it was in the
opposite direction. We tested this value against a null
hypothesis of no-shift by two-tailed, one-sample t-test
(Experiments 3–5), or by analysis of variance using eye
condition (open or closed) as a repeated measure (Experiments 1 and 2).
6.2. Imagery adaptation
A small but highly signiﬁcant aftereffect from imagery
was observed, evident in the population data ﬁts (Fig. 2),
and the individual data ﬁts (Fig. 3). The individual data
from up/down imagery (Experiment 1) showed a separation between the motion response functions of

0.15 ± 0.05 (mean ± sem) units of normalized coherence
(F(1,28) = 9.3; P = 0.005). There was no signiﬁcant difference between the size of the effect from imagery with
the eyes closed (0.19 ± 0.06) vs. eyes open (0.11 ± 0.05)
(F(1,28) = 2.5, P = 0.12).
In/out imagery (Experiment 2) also yielded signiﬁcant
motion aftereffects, with a separation between the functions for inward vs. outward imagery of 0.08 ± 0.03 units
of normalized coherence (F(1,27) = 6.8; P = 0.015). As with
the up/down imagery experiment, the motion aftereffect
from imagery with the eyes closed (0.10 ± 0.04) was not
signiﬁcantly different from the effect with the eyes open
(0.06 ± 0.03) (F(1,27) = 2.3; P = 0.145).
Note that if the data for individual participants are replotted with the actual coherence values of the test stimuli
instead of normalized units, then the shape of the curves
for each is exactly the same; only the scale of the x-axis
changes. Reanalysis with these actual coherence values
yields the same pattern of results. The size of the aftereffects in terms of actual coherence was 4.7 ± 1.4%
(F(1,28) = 10.9; P = 0.003) for the up/down imagery experiment and 2.9 ± 1.4% (F(1,27) = 4.3; P = 0.049) for the inward/outward imagery experiment.

Fig. 3. Aftereffects summarized by model ﬁts to individual participant data. Upper left: Separation between paired motion sensitivity curves, either with the
eyes closed or open during imagery (mean ± sem). Text labels indicate the size of the shift in units of un-normalized motion coherence. Positive values
represent a shift consistent with a motion aftereffect (e.g., increased likelihood of responding upward after downward imagery). Up/down and in/out
imagery both led to signiﬁcant motion aftereffects, with numerically larger shifts with the eyes closed than open. Upper right: The effect of delay between
the imagery period and the onset of the test probe. A signiﬁcant aftereffect is found with a 1-s delay, replicating the previous imagery experiment (third bar,
upper left). The effect is weaker with longer delays. Lower panel: Scatterplot depicting each participant’s paired null points following imagery. Each data
point represents the amount of motion coherence at which the paired motion sensitivity functions cross the 50% point, either for up/down imagery (circles)
or in/out imagery (x’s). Points above the identity line correspond to a separation between motion sensitivity curves in the direction predicted by an
aftereffect.

6.3. Decay of adaptation from imagery
Experiment 3 showed that a brief delay between imagery and test probe weakened the adaptation effect (Fig. 3,
right). A 1-s delay, identical to that in the ﬁrst two experiments, produced a reliable motion aftereffect (0.11 ± 0.5
units of normalized coherence), about equal in magnitude
to the aftereffect in the corresponding condition in the previous imagery experiment (in-out, eyes closed,
0.10 ± 0.04). The effect declined with longer delays, (4 s,
0.06 ± 0.06; 13 s, 0.01 ± 0.06), with a signiﬁcant difference
between the shortest and longest delay (T(26) = 1.73;
P = 0.047, one-tailed, paired t-test).
6.4. Adaptation to real visual motion
As expected, viewing real visual motion led to a robust
motion aftereffect (Fig. 4). For upward and downward motion, the separation between the two functions following

opposite directions of adaptation, based on ﬁts to individual participants, was 0.73 ± 0.25 units of normalized coherence (t(23) = 2.92, P = 0.008, two-tailed one-sample t-test),
or 21 ± 6.4% in terms of the un-normalized coherence
(t(23) = 3.44, P = 0.002). Adaptation to inward or outward
motion also led to a large motion aftereffect: a separation
between curves of 0.37 ± 0.04 units of normalized coherence (t(6) = 9.02, P = 0.0001). These effects were about 3–
4 bigger than those found from imagery.
7. Discussion
In these studies participants imagined motion in a particular direction and were then asked to judge the direction of motion of a moving-dots stimulus. We found that
imagining motion produced a motion aftereffect. For
example, after imagining motion down, participants were
more likely to perceive a set of moving dots as moving
up (opposite the direction of imagery). These results dem-

Fig. 4. Motion aftereffects following adaptation to real visual motion, either upward or downward (top left) or inward and outward (top right) Positive
values on the x-axis indicate upward motion or inward motion. The aftereffect is about 3–4 larger than that observed following imagery adaptation

onstrate for the ﬁrst time that imagery of motion recruits
direction-selective neural mechanisms that are also used
for perceiving real motion. The motion aftereffects we observed from imagery were smaller than those from real
motion, consistent with reports showing less activation
of sensory cortical areas from motion imagery than from
perception of the same stimuli (Goebel et al., 1998; Grossman & Blake, 2001). Our results show that visual imagery
of motion can affect the perception of subsequent physical
motion stimuli, and that perception and imagery of motion
rely on shared direction-selective neural mechanisms.
Two important alternative explanations can be ruled
out based on the pattern of results. First, the motion aftereffect obtained from in/out imagery discounts the possibility that the effects we report are due to eye movements
and not imagery, such as the motion aftereffects caused
by pursuit eye movements in the absence of motion perception (Chaudhuri, 1990, 1991; Freeman, Sumnall, &
Snowden, 2003). Second, the motion aftereffect from imagery with the eyes closed argues against visual attention as
the source of the effects, such as the motion aftereffects
observed from attentional ampliﬁcation of real motion sig-

nals (Alais & Blake, 1999) or attentional tracking of moving
stimuli (Culham, Verstraten, Ashida, & Cavanagh, 2000).
Although one might posit that participants attended to
an internal stimulus, this explanation still requires that
imagery recruits direction-selective motion mechanisms
in the absence of sensory input, in accord with our interpretation. Attentional mechanisms for a stimulus or feature, by contrast, presumably operate on representations
that are delivered by feed-forward inputs.
Moreover, two results suggest that the aftereffects were
not due to a simple cognitive bias. First, a brief delay after
imagery adaptation weakened the effect, as has been found
for adaptation to real motion (Keck & Pentz, 1977). Because
the direction of imagery was always the same within a
block of 48 trials, it is unlikely that participants relying
on an explicit response bias strategy would simply forget
which way to respond after such a brief delay. A knowledge-based bias might be expected to be present throughout the block.
Secondly, debrieﬁng following Experiment 1 suggests
that participants were not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by their
knowledge of motion aftereffects or expectations of the

experiment. The participants were asked two questions at
the end of the experiment: Have you ever heard of the ‘Motion Aftereffect’ before, and After viewing upward motion,
would you expect a static image to appear to move up or
down. The answers to these questions were not predictive
of the observed MAEs: participants who reported having
heard (n = 7) vs. not having heard (n = 17) of the MAE
showed shifts of 0.13 ± 0.03 vs. 0.10 ± 0.01 in the motion
response curves following opposite directions of imagery
(t(22) = .631; P = 0.53, two-tailed, unpaired t-test), pooling
across eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. The 17 participants who had not heard of the motion aftereffect were
evenly divided in their responses as to whether a static image would appear to move in the opposite (n = 8) vs. the
same (n = 8) direction of prior viewing of motion; one participant responded that it would not appear to move at all.
Our results are consistent with prior psychophysical
studies on spatial imagery (Ishai & Sagi, 1995) and the
imagery and inference of motion. Gilden and colleagues
(1995) demonstrated that adaptation to real visual motion
affected imagery of motion, the converse of our experiments. Importantly, however, the authors attributed their
results to an effect of motion adaptation on the imagined
location of a stimulus, not an effect of motion adaptation
on motion imagery. This explanation would not apply to
our experimental paradigm, since the imagined stimuli
occupied the same location regardless of the direction of
motion. Our results are also consistent with a prior ﬁnding
that imagining motion can lead to the illusion of roll vection, whereby spatial judgments are altered by imagery
of rotation (Mast, Berthoz, & Kosslyn, 2001). Previously
we observed that passive viewing of photographs that depict motion can lead to a motion aftereffect (Winawer
et al., 2008). Our current studies add to these by showing
for the ﬁrst time that motion imagery, in the absence of
motion perception and even in the absence of any visual
input, can recruit and adapt directional motion mechanisms. More generally, our results indicate that top-down
signals in the brain can selectively exert speciﬁc effects
on appropriate subpopulations of sensory neurons.

Appendix A. Measurement of motion response
functions
A.1. Display and dots stimulus used
Participants sat in a quiet, dark room, approximately
40 cm from an iMac CRT monitor (resolution: 1024  768
pixels (26  19.5 cm), refresh rate: 75 Hz).
The test stimulus for the up/down imagery and real motion adaptation experiments consisted of 100 dots in a
rectangular window whose length and width were 33% of
the entire display (approximately 12 by 9 degrees of visual

7

angle). On each frame a subset of the dots were selected to
move coherently up or down. All other dots disappeared
and randomly reappeared at any location within the test
window. A new set of dots was re-selected for coherent
movement on each frame. This ‘‘limited lifetime” procedure was used so that the trajectory of single dots could
not be followed throughout a trial. Each test trial consisted
of 25 frames displayed for 40 ms each (1 s total). Dot displacement for coherent motion was 0.11° per frame.
For the inward/outward experiments, the test stimulus
consisted of 200 dots, 100 on each side of ﬁxation. On a given trial the coherent component of the dots motion was
horizontal either inward or outward (towards or away
from the vertical midline). The stimulus was otherwise
identical to the test stimulus used for the up/down
experiments.
A.2. Baseline motion discrimination task
To determine an appropriate range of motion coherences for each participant, all participants ﬁrst completed
a baseline motion discrimination task. Moving-dot displays
were presented in 1-s trials with up to 65% of dots moving
coherently preceding up/down experiments and up to
100% preceding in/out experiments. The coherence values
producing 99% correct responses in each direction based
on logistic ﬁts to the responses were used to determine
the maximum test coherence for the adaptation phase of
the experiments. As this value depended on the participant’s performance on the baseline task, it differed across
participants (36 ± 17% and 35 ± 12%, mean ± SD, for the
up/down and in-out imagery experiments, respectively).
We deﬁned this value as 1 unit of normalized coherence
in order to make comparisons across participants. For the
up-down experiments, coherence values of one-half and
one-quarter of this value were used as test stimuli, giving
6 test stimuli for each participant (±1, ±0.5, and ± 0.25
‘‘normalized” coherence.) For the in-out experiments, the
normalized coherence values were sampled more ﬁnely:
±1, ±0.67, ±0.44, ±0.29, ±0.19, ±0.13, ±0.08, ±0.05, ±0.03,
±0.02, ±0.01, and 0.
A.3. Logistic regression ﬁts to motion response functions
A.3.1. Population ﬁts
The responses to moving-dot test stimuli were modeled
as a logistic regression. The model ﬁt to the aggregate data
(all participants in the population) for a given pair of
opposing adapting conditions used the following equation,
ﬁt with a maximum likelihood algorithm,

PðxÞ ¼ @=2 þ ð1  @Þ  1=ð1 þ YÞ;

ð1Þ

where Y ¼ exp½ða þ b  x þ c  AÞ
In this equation, x is the motion signal in normalized
units of coherence (with positive values assigned to either
upward or inward motion and negative values assigned to
downward or outward motion). P(x) is the probability that
the participant indicates upward (or inward) motion. A is
the direction of motion imagery or real motion preceding
the dot trial (+1 or 1), and a, ß, c, and @ are free parame-

added to a stimulus in one adaptation condition to make it
perceptually equivalent to the same stimulus in the opposite adaptation condition. The 95% conﬁdence interval for
each parameter estimate was determined by bootstrapping: 1000 simulated data sets were generated for each
pair of adaptation conditions based on the actual population mean responses, each data set was ﬁtted by Eq. (1),
the 1000 parameter estimates were rank ordered, and the
975th and 25th values were taken as the conﬁdence
intervals.
A.3.2. Individual ﬁts
The model ﬁts for individual participants used a similar
equation, but because there was less data for individual
participants than for the whole population, fewer free
parameters were used:

PðxÞ ¼ 1=ð1 þ YÞ;

where Y

¼ exp½ða þ b  x þ c1  A1 þ . . . þ cn  An Þ

ð2Þ

This model differs from the population model in that
there was no parameter @ to model the asymptote and,
for the imagery experiments, the effects of adaptation were
modeled in a single equation for all conditions. Thus for
Experiments 1 and 2, there were two adaptation terms,
one for the eyes-closed condition (c1) and one for the
eyes-open condition (c2). For Experiment 3, there were
three adaptation terms for the three delay conditions (c1,
c2, c3). For the real motion adaptation experiments, only
one adaptation parameter was modeled (c1). In all experiments, the motion sensitivity (ß) and global bias (a) were
estimated only once per participant, whereas for the group
data in the imagery experiments these parameters were ﬁt
separately for each pair of adapting conditions (eyes open
and eyes closed). As with the population ﬁts, dividing
2  c by ß yields the separation between the paired
curves in units of coherence. The mean of this value across
participants was taken as the effect of adaptation for each
pair of adaptation conditions.
A.4. Participants excluded from analysis
Fifteen participants were excluded from analysis for
failing to perform well on the motion discrimination task.
Nine participants (2 of 33 doing up/down imagery, 2 of
31 doing in/out imagery, 2 of 30 in the imagery-delay
experiment, and 3 of 31 viewing up/down real motion)
did not show a signiﬁcant effect of motion coherence. For
these participants, the probability of an ‘‘up” or ‘‘in” response did not signiﬁcantly increase with increased coherence in that direction in the test stimulus. Speciﬁcally, the
parameter estimated for motion coherence in a logistic
regression ﬁt was less than the standard error of the same
parameter estimate. Six other participants, (1 of 33 doing

up/down imagery, 1 of 31 doing in/out imagery, 1 of 30
in the imagery-delay experiment, and 3 of 31 doing up/
down real motion), performed poorly in the baseline motion discrimination task such that curve ﬁts yielded a unit
of normalized coherence as values >100% actual coherence.
These participants were excluded from analysis.
