Introduction
When a repeated item is embedded in a series of items displayed in rapid serial visual
presentation (RSVP), an observer will often fail to report the repetition—a phenomenon
commonly known as repetition blindness (RB). Morris and Still (2008) addressed a
discrepancy in the RB literature regarding nonwords, that is, pronounceable strings of letters
that are not English words: Some previous studies had found repetition blindness, others
failed to do so, and still others reported a repetition advantage (RA) for nonwords. Morris
and Still proposed that a repetition advantage could result if observers use partial
orthographic information when they are aware that some trials contain repetitions. An
observer who has encoded the first of two targets can use partial information about the
second target to make an informed guess: If the partial information matches the first target,
the observer should guess that the trial contained a repeated item.
In a series of experiments, Morris and Still (2008) found that RA and RB could be
observed for both words and nonwords depending on whether participants could capitalize
on such an informed guessing strategy. In the final experiment of the study (Experiment 6,
pp. 161–3), they presented trials in which critical words and nonwords were either dissimilar
to each other (for example, phub and snoy) or orthographic neighbors (for example, blem and
blom). Trials never contained repeated words, so guessing a repetition in the case of a partial
orthographic match would not be a useful strategy. The authors found that participants rarely
reported repetitions, and observed an RB for both word and nonword orthographic
neighbors. The present study will replicate Experiment 6 of Morris and Still (2008); the
primary finding for replication is that RB occurs for nonwords.

Methods
Power analysis
The primary effect for replication was a significant RB effect for nonwords, F1(1, 23)
= 13.71, p < .005. Effect size was not reported in the manuscript and original data were
unavailable. Following Lakens (2013), partial eta squared was calculated as
𝜂!! =

!×!"effect
!×!"effect !!"error

=

!".!"×!
!".!"×! !!"

= 0.374 .

(Equation 1)

This value was used in G*Power 3.1 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007) to calculate
the sample size required to achieve sufficient power to detect the estimated effect. For a typeI error rate of α = 0.05, 16 participants suffices to achieve 80% power; 20 to achieve 90%
power; and 24 to achieve 95% power. The G*Power outputs are available from the
Reproducibility Project: Psychology page of the Open Science Framework.1
Planned sample
Twenty-four participants will be recruited for the study. This matches the size of the
sample in the original study, and achieves 95% power to detect an effect of the estimated size.
Participants will be paid AUD $15 per hour of testing or part thereof; it is anticipated that
each testing session will last less than one hour. They will be recruited using advertisements
placed on noticeboards around the Camperdown Campus of the University of Sydney; most
participants are likely to be students of the University. As in the original study, participants
will be native speakers of English (but may be bilingual).
Materials
Word lists were identical to those used by Morris and Still (2008). “[Critical items
(C2) were 48] words and [48] pronounceable nonwords; nonwords were selected from the
ARC Nonword Database (Rastle, Harrington, & Coltheart, 2002). All items were 4 letters in
length and [most] were monosyllabic. Orthographic neighborhood size (orthographic N) was
included as a factor in the design; half the words and nonwords had an orthographic N of 12
or greater, and the other half had an orthographic N of 5 or less. High-N and low-N words
were similar in print frequency (15 per million; Francis & Kučera, 1982).” (Morris & Still,
2008, p. 150)
“Sequences of 3 words or 3 nonwords were created with the first and last words or
nonwords designated C1 and C2. These were then made into 6-item RSVP streams by
displaying rows of symbols (e.g., %%%%, ####) as the first, second, and sixth items in each
RSVP stream. The words or nonwords occupied the third, fourth, and fifth positions in each
RSVP stream.” (Morris & Still, 2008, p. 150)

“Each [C2] item… appeared in [two] conditions: … control and neighbor. To create
the neighbor condition, words and nonwords were paired with an orthographic neighbor C1
(e.g. cast was paired with cart). The control condition was created… by substituting an
orthographically nonsimilar word or nonword for C1. Words or nonwords intervening
between C1 and C2 were selected from a separate pool of items having N sizes between 4
and 12; these words were orthographically dissimilar to C1 and C2. [Two]2 versions of the
stimulus list were created such that each participant viewed [12] three-word lists in… the
high-N neighbor condition, 12 in the high-N control condition, [12] in the low-N neighbor
condition, and 12 in the low-N control condition. The same was true for the 3-nonword lists.
Each item appeared in… neighbor and control conditions, counterbalanced across
participants. In addition to these trials, participants also viewed 40 RSVP streams with only 2
words or nonwords (a row of symbols was substituted for the intervening word or nonword).
Participants viewed each critical word or non-word only once. In all versions of the stimulus
list, word and nonword lists were randomly intermixed” (Morris & Still, 2008, p. 156). Each
list was always presented in the same order (A. L. Morris, personal communication).
“Stimuli were displayed in a white font… (Chicago [FLF]) on a black background”
(Morris & Still, 2008, p. 150). Letters subtended an average of approximately .57° × .86° of
visual angle at a viewing distance of 50 cm.3
Procedure
Participants had responded to an advertisement for paid research participation in a
study of visual processing, the purpose of which was to “investigate how people process visual
information that is presented very briefly, making it hard to be sure of what you have just
seen.” Immediately prior to the experiment, they were given brief instructions: On each trial
of the experiment, they would view a short sequence of words or word-like strings of letters
(nonwords), interspersed with strings of symbols; their task was to report all of the words or
non-words they saw during the trial. “Participants were warned that ‘some of the words or
nonwords will look similar to each other’ and that they should read them carefully” (Morris
& Still, 2008, p. 156).
“Each trial began with a “+” displayed in the middle of the computer screen for [558]

The Methods section of the original experiment does not indicate how many versions were used (Morris &
Still, 2008, Experiment 6, p. 162). The stimuli used in Experiment 6 were based on those used in Experiment 3,
in which there were four versions of the list (Morris & Still, 2008, p. 156). However, the original author has
confirmed that only two versions of the stimulus list were used in Experiment 6 (A. L. Morris, personal
communication).

To acquire the original viewing distance, and to match the angular subtense of the stimuli in the original study,
we referred to Morris, Still, and Caldwell–Harris (2009), which reports experiments that appear to have been
performed using the same apparatus: “All letters were displayed in… Chicago 36 font [as in Morris & Still
(2008)]… Letters in this font subtended an average of approximately .57° × .86° of visual angle at a viewing
distance of 50 cm” (p. 356).

ms, followed by a blank interval of [558] ms. The RSVP stream was then displayed with each
item appearing for [125] ms. Following the RSVP stream, a “?” was displayed to indicate that
the participant should report the items.” (Morris & Still, 2008, p. 150)
“[P]articipants named all words or nonwords displayed…” (Morris & Still, 2008, p.
150). “[P]articipants first reported their responses to the experimenter and then typed the
words or nonwords, with a space between each item, using the computer keyboard. They
were allowed to correct typing mistakes with the delete key” (p. 162). “[T]he experimenter
[also] coded the response into the data file by using [a] computer keyboard…” (p. 150) “The
next trial began immediately after the experimenter keyed in the participant’s response… The
experimental trials were preceded by 10 practice trials.” (p. 150)
Analysis plan
Data preparation and scoring
The original manuscript does not describe any rules for data cleaning or exclusion; the
present study will thus include all collected data. As in the original manuscript, analyses will
use the participants’ typed responses rather than their spoken responses as recorded by the
experimenter (Morris & Still, 2008, p. 162). Analyses will be performed automatically using a
custom MATLAB script, which is available from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology page of
the Open Science Framework.4
The code for the experiment allows participants to enter 0, 1, 2 or 3 four-letter words
in response to each trial; the analysis code for critical pair recall scores a trial as correct if both
critical items (C1 and C2) are reported exactly correctly in any response position (that is,
irrespective of report order).5 The analysis code for intervening item recall scores a trial as
correct if the intervening item (I) is reported exactly correctly in any response position. The
analysis code for additional analyses scores an item (C1, C2 or I) as correct if at least two
letters of the word or nonword are reported in the correct position within the word, in any
response position. Each response is matched to one item only. For example, given the items
(C1) lood (I) filk (C2) loof and the response ‘look firk’, C1 and I are scored as correct; however,
C2 is scored as incorrect—even though it shares three letters with the response look—because
look has been matched already to C1.
Statistical analyses
Following the original study, each statistical test will take the form of a repeatedmeasures analysis of variance (ANOVA). These will be conducted using SPSS Statistics for
4

https://osf.io/rmvk5/.
The original manuscript does not appear to specify whether participants were required to report items in the
correct order. However, the original authors perform their analyses “following Coltheart and Langdon (2003)”
(Morris & Still, 2008, p. 150), who did not ask participants to reproduce word order.

GOODBOURN • REPLICATION OF MORRIS & STILL (2008)

Mac 21.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). The MATLAB analysis script produces SPSS
syntax files containing all data and commands required to perform the analyses automatically.
As in many psycholinguistic studies (including the original study), two forms of ANOVA
will be conducted: The first takes participants as cases (reported as F1), and the second takes
items as cases (reported as F2).
Critical pair recall will be analyzed using a three-way repeated-measures ANOVA.
Using participants as cases, condition (control, neighbor), lexicality (word, nonword) and
neighborhood size (low-N, high-N) will be within-subject factors. Using items as cases,
condition (control, neighbor) will be a within-item factor, and lexicality and neighborhood
size will be between-item factors. As in the original study, any significant two-way
interactions will be examined further using one-way ANOVAs. Intervening item recall will be
analyzed in the same manner. For informal comparison with the original study, additional
analyses will be performed by tabulating the mean percentage of partial recall as a function of
item (C1, I, C2) and lexicality (word, nonword).
Primary effect for replication
The primary effect for replication is a significant RB effect for nonwords. For the
current purposes, we will consider the finding to have been replicated if a significant RB
effect (p < .05) is found in a one-way ANOVA of nonword items, using participants as cases
and Condition as a within-subject factor.
Differences from the original study
Participants
In the original study, participants took part in return for course credit (Morris & Still,
2008, p. 162); whereas in the present study, participants will be reimbursed AUD $15 per
hour. The original study took place at Iowa State University (p. 162), and participants are
most likely to have been American students. The present study will take place at the
University of Sydney, and participants are most likely to be Australian students. It is not
anticipated that these differences will affect the outcome of the study.
Materials
Both versions of the original stimulus list were recovered from the authors; the lists
are available from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology page of the Open Science
Framework.6 The computer code used to run the experiment could not be obtained from the
authors of the original study owing to the failure of the computer used in that study. The
experiment was originally programmed in PsyScope (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost,

1993; Morris & Still, 2008, p. 150), which is no longer supported and will not run on current
versions of the Apple operating system (OSX).7 As the entire experiment required
reprogramming, we used MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) with Psychtoolbox-3
extensions (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997). The experimental code is available from the
Reproducibility Project: Psychology page of the Open Science Framework.8
The original study presented stimuli in Chicago font (Morris & Still, 2008, p. 150),
which is no longer distributed as part of the Apple OS. The present study instead uses the
public domain version, Chicago FLF.9 None of these differences should affect the outcome of
the study.
Apparatus
In the original study, stimuli were presented using a Macintosh G4 (Apple Inc.,
Cupertino, CA) and PsyScope software (Morris & Still, 2008, p. 150). In the present study,
stimuli will be presented using a MacBook Pro with a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 8
GB of RAM, running Mac OSX 10.7.5 with MATLAB R2012b and PsychToolbox-3
extensions. Stimuli will be processed on a Radeon HD 6770M video card (AMD, Sunnyvale,
CA).
The type of monitor used in the original study was not specified in the manuscript.
The present study will display stimuli on a P1120 FD Trinitron® CRT monitor (HewlettPackard, Palo Alto, CA) with a spatial resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels and a refresh rate of
120 Hz. With stimulus changes synchronized to the refresh rate of the monitor, each fixation
and blank interval will be presented for 558 ms, and each RSVP item will be presented from
125 ms. This is, respectively, 2 ms and 1 ms shorter than the durations reported in the
original manuscript (Morris & Still, 2008, p. 150); however, we note that no integer refresh
rate in the range 60–120 Hz would allow stimulus durations of both 126 ms and 560 ms.
There is no reason to suspect that any of these differences will affect the outcome of the
study.

(Post data collection) Methods addendum
Actual sample
As planned, twenty-four participants were recruited for the study.
Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
There were no differences from the pre-data collection methods plan. The MATLAB
analysis script was altered slightly because in the original version, standard errors of the mean
did not display correctly in figures. A two-way version of the intervening item recall analysis
(with Condition and Lexicality, but not Neighborhood, as factors) was also added, because
Morris and Still (2008) appear to have analyzed it in this way; note, however, that this
pertains to exploratory analyses and does not bear on the confirmatory analysis of the primary
effect. The updated version is available from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology page of the
Open Science Framework.10
We also made two changes to the pre-replication section of this report. First, we
corrected an error that described Condition as a between-subjects factor when participants
are treated as cases (F1). It is, in fact, a within-subjects factor; it is a between-subjects factor
when items are treated as cases (F2). Second, following a suggestion raised during peer review
of the post-replication report, we augmented the description in the Procedure section of the
instructions given to participants.

Confirmatory analysis
The primary effect for replication was a significant RB effect for nonwords. A oneway ANOVA of nonword items, using participants as cases and Condition as a withinsubject factor, did not find a significant RB effect, F1(1, 23) = 1.28, η2p1 = .051, p1 = .269.12

We note that for the analysis with items as cases, the original report gives the error degrees of freedom as 46.
For a one-way ANOVA of 48 items, we would expect the error degrees of freedom to be 47; and for a simpleeffects analysis following three-way ANOVA, we would expect the error degrees of freedom to be 92 as in the
overall design. This suggests that the reported statistic may be the main effect of Condition from a two-way
ANOVA of nonwords, with Condition as a within-item factor and Neighborhood as a between-item factor.

We also screened each participant’s data for anomalies that might have masked an RB effect
(for example, one participant failed to correctly report any critical pair), but excluding
participants or subsets of participants who performed poorly made no appreciable difference
to the results.
Exploratory analyses
Critical pair recall
Figure 1 shows the mean percentage of correct recall of both critical items for the
various conditions, for both the current replication (Figure 1a) and the original study (Figure
1b). For the current replication, repeated-measures ANOVAs with the factors Condition,
Lexicality, and Neighborhood size demonstrated that joint report of words was higher than
that for nonwords (48.9% vs. 10.8%), F1(1, 23) = 107.13, η2p1 = .823, F2(1, 92) = 321.05, η2p2
= .777, both p < .001; and control pairs were correctly reported at a higher rate than neighbor
pairs (35.8% vs. 23.9%), F1(1, 23) = 19.40, η2p1 = .458, F2(1, 92) = 41.86, η2p2 = .313, both p <
.001. The main effect of neighborhood size was not significant, F1(1, 23) = 0.13, η2p1 = .005,
p1 = .724, F2(1, 92) = 0.24, η2p2 = .003, p2 = .626. These results are similar to those reported by
Morris and Still (2008).
The Condition × Lexicality interaction was significant, F1(1, 23) = 19.18, η2p1 = .455,
F2(1, 92) = 27.32, η2p2 = .229, both p < .001; this interaction reflects a greater amount of RB
for words than for nonwords. The three-way Condition × Lexicality × Neighborhood size
interaction was significant, F1(1, 23) = 9.30, η2p1 = .287, F2(1, 92) = 7.93, η2p2 = .080, both p =
.006. This interaction may reflect that the RB effect for words is greater for low-N items
than for high-N items, while the RB effect for nonwords is greater for high-N items than for
low-N items.13 None of the other interactions was significant in both the subjects and the
items analyses, although the Condition × Neighborhood size interaction was borderline
significant in the subjects analysis, F1(1, 23) = 4.23, η2p1 = .156, p1 = .051, F2(1, 92) = 2.74,
η2p2 = .029, p2 = .101. These results are similar to those reported by Morris and Still (2008),
except they did not find a significant three-way interaction.

For the present data, such an ANOVA reveals no significant main effect of Condition, F1(1, 23) = 1.26, η2p1 =
.052, p1 = .273, F2(1, 46) = 1.51, η2p2 = .032, p2 = .226.
13
This interpretation is corroborated by simple two-way interaction analysis (performed using MMATRIX in
SPSS, with participants as cases), which reveals a significant Condition × Neighborhood interaction for words
whereby the RB effect is greater for low-N words than for high-N words (p = .003); but not for nonwords (p =
.332), for which the interaction shows a numerical trend in the opposite direction.

Additional analyses
Morris and Still (2008) “calculated the percentage of trials on which at least two
letters of a word or nonword were reported correctly” to “provide a better estimate of the
availability of partial orthographic information from three-item RSVP displays” (p. 162).
“For example, suppose the stimulus item bink juff rast was reported as bink just raff. With the
standard scoring, neither the joint report of critical items nor the report of the intervening
item would be scored as correct. With the alternative scoring, however, all three items (C1,
C2, and the intervening item) would be scored as correct” (pp. 162–3). Table 2 shows the
alternative scoring results from the control condition, in both the current replication and the
original study. As in the original study, participants in the current replication were able to
report a significant percentage of the letters from the word and nonword displays in the
control condition.

Discussion
Summary of replication attempt
The current study attempted to replicate Experiment 6 of Morris and Still (2008),
who found a significant RB effect for nonwords. We failed to replicate the original result:
We did not find a significant main effect of Condition in one-way ANOVA of nonword
items, using participants as cases.
Commentary
While the current study failed to replicate the primary effect of RB for nonwords, we
found results similar to those reported for nearly all other analyses. Like Morris and Still, we
found an intervening item effect, such that the intervening item was reported more often in
the neighbor condition than in the control condition. As the original authors note, this is
consistent with a competition model: “[W]hen C2 is orthographically similar to C1, C2’s
representation will be associated with less activation than will a control C2, and therefore will
compete less effectively against adjacent items. The result is a net gain in competitiveness for
the item immediately preceding the orthographically similar C2” (p. 161). Similarly, we also
found that participants could report a significant percentage of the letters from the word and
nonword displays in the control condition. “The implication is that a strategy of guessing
repetitions will be effective for many participants because their access to partial orthographic
information will be sufficient to avoid spurious reports of repetitions on control trials” (p.
163). Further, overall levels of performance were similar to those reported in the original
study.
It should be noted that Experiment 6 of Morris and Still (2008) is almost a direct
replication of their Experiment 5, which also revealed RB for nonwords. In Experiment 5,
participants reported their responses to the experimenter; while in Experiment 6 and the
current replication, participants also typed their responses. Experiments 3 and 4 likewise
found an RB effect for nonword neighbors; thus the original report contains an additional
three studies supporting the findings of Experiment 6. We conducted a rudimentary metaanalysis of these four experiments, as well as the current replication, using an R script
provided by Carter and McCullough (2014) and modified by D. Lakens.15 We estimated
partial eta squared as in Equation 1, and then converted to Cohen’s d,

Figure 2. Meta-analysis and forest plot of RB effects for nonwords. The forest plot shows Cohen’s d
(square icons for individual experiments; central vertices of the diamond for overall data) and 95%
confidence intervals (whiskers for individual experiments; horizontal extent of the diamond for overall
data). The solid vertical line corresponds to no effect (d = 0), and the dashed vertical line corresponds
to the estimated overall effect (d = 1.26). For all experiments, N = 24.

Figure 2 shows the results of the meta-analysis of RB effects for nonwords across the

five experiments. Clearly, the estimate of effect size in the current study differs from those in
the four experiments reported by Morris and Still (2008). However, there is little reason to
believe that the latter estimates are overly inflated by the ‘statistical significance filter’, or

‘winner’s curse’ (Ioannidis, 2008). All four experiments employed very similar experimental

methods and the same analytical methods, which restricts experimenter degrees of freedom;
there is no cause to suspect that they were reported selectively; and their effect size estimates

are highly consistent with each other. We could not identify any differences between the

original study and the current replication likely to affect the results; nor did the

corresponding author of the original study raise concerns about our final replication plan (A.
L. Morris, personal communication). Similar overall levels of performance were observed in

both studies, and nearly all of the results of additional analyses were highly consistent

between them. It is thus plausible that the failure of the current study to replicate the primary
effect is a statistical anomaly.

The RB effect for nonwords may be particularly volatile owing to a low overall level of

correct reporting of critical nonword pairs. From Figure 1b (reproduced from Morris & Still,

2008, Figure 11) we estimate that in the original study, nonword pairs were correctly
reported on only 9.4% of neighbor trials and 16.7% of control trials. Each participant,

however, only responds to 24 trials in each of these two conditions. On average, then, a
participant correctly reported a neighbor pair on 2.3 trials, and correctly reported a control

pair on 4.0 trials. In the current replication, the corresponding figures are 2.3 trials (9.7%)
and 2.9 trials (12.0%), respectively. Thus, a single trial distinguishes the average participant in

the original study from the average participant in the current replication: In the current

replication, control pairs were correctly reported on 1.1 fewer trials per participant than in the
12

GOODBOURN • REPLICATION OF MORRIS & STILL (2008)

original study.
If the above diagnosis is accurate, the current replication attempt highlights an
important point, namely that a failed replication does not necessarily indicate an incorrect
hypothesis. Some experiments may instead fail to replicate because of methodological
difficulties that render a real effect fragile. One merit of replications that fail for this reason is
that they can help to reveal those aspects of the methodology that contribute to the instability
of the effect. In the present case, a more robust RB effect would likely be found under
experimental conditions that produce a higher overall proportion of correct reports (perhaps
an increase in presentation times, or a reduction in the contrast of post-masks). Direct
replications can thus contribute to scientific progress not only by identifying effects that may
be spurious, but also by identifying methodological issues that can hamper the detection of
real effects.
