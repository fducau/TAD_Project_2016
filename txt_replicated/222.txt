BRIEF REPORT

Is Optimism Real?
Joseph P. Simmons and Cade Massey
University of Pennsylvania
Is optimism real, or are optimistic forecasts just cheap talk? To help answer this question, we investigated
whether optimistic predictions persist in the face of large incentives to be accurate. We asked National
Football League football fans to predict the winner of a single game. Roughly half (the partisans)
predicted a game involving their favorite team, and the other half (the neutrals) predicted a game
involving 2 teams they were neutral about. Participants were promised either a small incentive ($5) or
a large incentive ($50) for correctly predicting the game’s winner. Optimism emerged even when
incentives were large, as partisans were much more likely than neutrals to predict partisans’ favorite
teams to win. Strong optimism also emerged among participants whose responses to follow-up questions
strongly suggested that they believed the predictions they made. This research supports the claim that
optimism is real.

the absolute outcome of an uncontrollable event (Massey et al.,
2011)—a third critique is more challenging: Since there is little
cost to doing so, people may choose to respond optimistically even
when they do not believe it. For example, a sports fan may predict
that his favorite team will win an upcoming game not because he
genuinely believes this but because of a low-cost desire to be loyal
to his team. Is optimistic responding just cheap talk, or do people
respond optimistically even when they are motivated to give
accurate predictions?
One way to answer this is to investigate whether optimism
persists in the face of large incentives for accuracy (Grether, 1980;
Levitt & List, 2007). On this question the evidence is mixed. On
the one hand, Armor and Sackett (2006) found more optimism for
hypothetical than for real events, suggesting that optimism may be
reduced or even eliminated by immediate consequences. On the
other hand, Williams and Gilovich (2008) found that participants
were as willing to bet on their own optimistic beliefs as they were
on equally likely objective gambles, suggesting they truly believed
their optimistic predictions.
A weakness of these studies, as well as others showing optimism
in the face of incentives (Massey et al., 2011; Windschitl, Smith,
Rose, & Krizan, 2010), is that the incentives were modest. Should
we believe that people, free to wed predictions to their desires in
the absence of incentives, suddenly decouple them in order to gain
$1? This seems unlikely, especially when desires are strong.
Hence, the fundamental question remains: Is optimism real?
We answered this question by investigating whether optimistic
predictions persist in the face of large incentives to be accurate. To
accomplish this, we asked National Football League (NFL) football fans to predict the winner of a single game. Roughly half (the
partisans) was asked to predict a game involving their favorite
team, and the other half (the neutrals) was asked to predict a game

Evidence for optimism abounds. People optimistically forecast
task completion (Buehler, Griffin, & Ross, 1994), task performance (Camerer & Lovallo, 1999), health outcomes (Weinstein,
1980), political outcomes (Krizan, Miller, & Johar, 2010), and
sporting outcomes (Massey, Simmons, & Armor, 2011). Despite
this seeming abundance of evidence, there are good reasons to
question whether optimistic predictions reflect true beliefs.
First, forecasts of controllable events, such as project completion times or competitive performance, may reflect strategic goal
setting. People may falsely express optimism for controllable
events because they believe that making optimistic forecasts will
motivate them to improve their performance (Zhang & Fishbach,
2010). Second, statistical artifacts, such as base rate regression and
scale attenuation, may underlie demonstrations of comparative
optimism— optimistic predictions of the self relative to others
(Harris & Hahn, 2011; Moore & Healy, 2008; Moore & Small,
2007). Harris and Hahn (2011) even suggested that “these statistical artifacts also raise questions about the very existence of a
general, unrealistically optimistic bias” (p. 149).
Although these critiques are navigable—for example, by showing that optimism persists even when people are asked to predict

involving two teams they were relatively neutral about. Predictions
are optimistic if partisans are more likely than neutrals to predict
the partisans’ preferred team to win. To assess whether optimism
reflects true beliefs, we also manipulated incentives. Participants
were promised either a small incentive ($5) or a large incentive
($50) for a correct prediction. If optimistic responding is mere
cheap talk, then a $50 incentive should eliminate it.
Obviously, though, the persistence of optimistic predictions in
the face of a $50 incentive does not prove that optimism is
genuine. It could be that although optimism persists when the
incentive is $50, it would not if the incentive were $500 or $5,000
or $50,000. One can try to navigate this critique by collecting
additional measures assessing whether or not participants were
responding truthfully. By including such measures in our study, we
were able to investigate whether optimism persisted even among
the subset of participants who, by all indications, genuinely believed the predictions they made.
We investigated football predictions in this study because this
domain offers important advantages. First, because football outcomes are uncontrollable and football predictions are noncomparative, optimistic responses in this domain cannot be explained by
strategic goal-setting and statistical artifacts. Second, football outcomes are unambiguous, imminent, and transparently beyond the
control of the experimenter (no participant could believe the experimenter has rigged the result) and thus easy to incentivize.
Third, because football fans are knowledgeable about the games
they are predicting, they are not simply guessing the correct
answer (cf. Windschitl et al., 2010). Finally, this domain offers
objective data indicating which team was better, conditional on
everything known at the time the prediction was made, thus
providing us with an unbiased assessment of decision quality. To
our knowledge, sporting events with active betting markets are the
only domains that offer all these important features.

Method
This report adheres to the requirements proposed by Simmons,
Nelson, and Simonsohn (2011).

Participants and Recruitment
Approximately 2 weeks before the start of the 2010 NFL football season, we e-mailed a large panel that we use to conduct
research, asking NFL football fans to complete a short web survey
indicating their interest in participating in football-related research.
This survey asked participants (N ⫽ 1,317) to indicate their e-mail
address, their most and least favorite NFL football teams, how
closely they followed NFL football (1 ⫽ not at all, 5 ⫽ extremely),
how often they watch Monday Night Football, their name, ZIP
code, country of residence, gender, birth month, and birth year.
They also took a four-item quiz, asking them to recall the previous
season’s Super Bowl winner and loser, and the losers of the two
conference championship games.
Those who completed this survey (N ⫽ 1,153) received a
follow-up survey asking them to rate how much they like (1 ⫽
strongly dislike, 5 ⫽ neutral, 9 ⫽ strongly like) and know about
(1 ⫽ nothing, 5 ⫽ almost everything) each NFL team. (Teams
were randomly ordered.) They again indicated their most and least
favorite NFL teams. We invited the 1,000 participants who indi-

cated the same favorite NFL team in both surveys to participate in
the experiment described below.
Trading off budgetary concerns and statistical power, we decided in advance to stop collecting data once roughly 800 participants had completed it. We did so after 770 participants responded
(53.6% male; Mage ⫽ 34.9 years).

Procedure
On the Thursday before Week 2’s NFL games (played on
Sunday and Monday), we e-mailed participants a survey asking
them to predict the winner of one of those games. Participants did
not know in advance which game they would be asked to predict.1
This study featured a 2 (partisans vs. neutrals) ⫻ 2 ($5 vs. $50
incentive) between-subjects design. Partisans predicted the winner
of the game involving their favorite team. Neutrals predicted the
winner of a game that involved neither their favorite nor least
favorite team. Neutrals were matched to partisans, so that the
proportion of partisans predicting each game was roughly the same
as the proportion of neutrals predicting each game. Indeed, by
design, the proportion of partisans versus neutrals distributed
across the 14 games was nearly identical, ␹2(13) ⫽ 2.51, p ⬎ .99
(see Table 1).
Participants in the $5 ($50) condition were told that they would
win a $5 ($50) Amazon.com gift certificate for correctly predicting
the game’s winner. To be sure they understood this information,
we instructed participants to type “I will win a [$5 or $50] gift
certificate if I correctly predict the winner of the NFL game.” All
but three participants typed this or some variant of it. We included
them in all analyses.
On the next page, participants were reminded of the reward for
an accurate prediction, and they predicted the winner of their
assigned NFL game. Participants could not change their prediction
once they made it.

Assessing Whether Participants Truly Believed Their
Predictions
Participants then answered 10 follow-up questions, each displayed on its own page. For brevity, we describe only the four
measures we used to assess whether participants truly believed
their predictions. We describe all measures in the supplemental
materials.
Subjective probability. Participants were asked, “What do
you think is the probability that the [predicted winner] will defeat
the [predicted loser]?” The response options ranged from 0% to
100%, in 1% increments.
Surprise. Participants were asked, “Will you be more surprised if the [visiting team] wins the game or if the [home team]
wins the game?” They answered on a 7-point scale, where 1 ⫽
extremely surprised if the [visiting team] wins, 4 ⫽ not at all
1
Sixteen games were scheduled for that week. We eliminated two
games from consideration because their large point spreads suggested
predicting them was too easy (and hence too financially costly for us). All
fans of the teams that played in these eliminated games were necessarily
assigned to the neutral condition. Fans of these teams performed just as
well as fans of other teams on the NFL quiz, t(768) ⫽ ⫺0.03, p ⫽ .98, and
were equal followers of NFL football, t(768) ⫽ 1.27, p ⫽ .21.

Prediction strategy.
Participants were asked, “Which of
these statements best explains why you predicted the [predicted
winner] to win the game?” The response options were (a) “I
genuinely believe they will win the game,” (b) “I do not genuinely
believe they will win, but I want them to win,” (c) “I do not
genuinely believe they will win, but I want them to lose,” and (d)
“I just guessed, because I don’t have any idea which team is going
to win the game.”
Before conducting the analyses reported below, we decided to
categorize participants as “true believers” only if they (a) indicated
that their predicted winner had a greater than 50% chance of
winning the game, (b) indicated they would be at least slightly
more surprised if their predicted winner lost, (c) rated their accuracy motivation a 7 (extremely motivated) on the 7-point scale, and
(d) indicated genuinely believing that their predicted winner would
win the game.

game. The spread incorporates all known information in order to

offer the best prediction of the game’s point differential, and thus
serves as an excellent normative standard against which to judge
predictions (Simmons, Nelson, Galak, & Frederick, 2011). Most
important for our purposes, the point spread defines the most likely
winner (the superior team) and the most likely loser (the inferior
team). A fully knowledgeable, unbiased person should predict
superior teams to win games.

Results

The means and percentages in Table 2 make clear that most
participants in all conditions expressed high confidence in their
predicted teams and indicated being very motivated to give accurate predictions. In addition, as one might expect, compared with
superior-team partisans, inferior-team partisans (a) estimated that
their predicted teams had a lower probability of winning and (b)
indicated being more surprised if their predicted team won. They
also indicated reduced accuracy motivation. Finally, compared
with those offered $5 for an accurate prediction, those offered $50
were more motivated to give an accurate prediction.

true in both the $5 (81.0%) and $50 (75.7%) conditions (ps ⬍
.001), which did not differ from each other, ␹2(1) ⫽ 1.64, p ⫽ .20.
However, partisans were more likely to be fans of superior teams
(54.5%) than fans of inferior teams. Thus, on aggregate, partisans
should predict their favorite teams to win, because they (and everyone
else) should predict superior teams to win games. Hence, it is important to distinguish fans of superior teams (who should predict their
favorite teams to win) from fans of inferior teams (who should not).
Accordingly, all subsequent analyses partitioned participants into
three groups: (a) superior-team partisans (n ⫽ 222), (b) neutrals (n ⫽
363), and (c) inferior-team partisans (n ⫽ 185).2 Analyses were
logistic regressions, regressing predictions (1 ⫽ predicted superior
team, 0 ⫽ predicted inferior team) on (a) Partisan, coded ⫺1, 0, and
1 for inferior-team partisans, neutrals, and superior-team partisans,
respectively; (b) Incentive, coded ⫺1 and 1 for $5 and $50, respectively; and (c) the Partisan ⫻ Incentive interaction. We report odds
ratios (OR) for each regression.
Optimism is manifest if superior-team (inferior-team) partisans
are more (less) likely than neutrals to predict superior teams to
win. Figure 1 displays this result. There was a large and significant
main effect of Partisan, indicating that optimism was strong overall
(OR ⫽ 4.80, SE ⫽ 0.69, p ⬍ .001). Additional analyses showed
that, compared with neutrals, superior-team partisans were significantly more likely (OR ⫽ 4.54, SE ⫽ 1.37, p ⬍ .001), and
inferior-team partisans were significantly less likely (OR ⫽ 4.91,
SE ⫽ 0.96, p ⬍ .001), to predict superior teams to win. There was
no main effect of Incentive: Participants were as likely to predict
superior teams when $50 was at stake as when $5 was at stake
(OR ⫽ 1.06, SE ⫽ 0.10, p ⫽ .54). Although optimism diminished
slightly in the $50 condition, the Partisan ⫻ Incentive interaction
was not significant (OR ⫽ 0.85, SE ⫽ 0.12, p ⫽ .25). Importantly,
within the $50 condition, there was a highly significant effect of
Partisan (OR ⫽ 4.07, SE ⫽ 0.81, p ⬍ .001), indicating rampant
optimism even when the stakes were considerable.
This result supports the claim that optimistic predictions reflect
true beliefs rather than cheap talk. But it is possible that $50 is
simply not enough incentive to motivate predictions people actually believe. To help resolve this issue, we analyzed the predictions
of true believers, whose responses to four follow-up questions
strongly implied that they believed the predictions they made (n ⫽
313; 41%; see Table 3). If optimism is just cheap talk, then true

believers should not respond optimistically, but Figure 2 shows
that they did. Analyses yielded a significant main effect of Partisan
(OR ⫽ 3.27, SE ⫽ 0.74, p ⬍ .001) and no other significant effects
(ps ⬎ .48). Additional analyses showed that, compared with
neutrals, superior-team partisans were significantly more likely
(OR ⫽ 2.33, SE ⫽ 1.00, p ⫽ .047), and inferior-team partisans
were significantly less likely (OR ⫽ 3.92, SE ⫽ 1.29, p ⬍ .001),
to predict superior teams to win. Even within the $50 condition,
the effect of Partisan was significant (OR ⫽ 2.86, SE ⫽ 0.84, p ⬍
.001). Thus, optimism was evident even among those who, by all
indications, truly believed their predictions.3

Discussion
If Kahneman (2011) is right that “in terms of its consequences,
the optimistic bias may well be the most significant of the cognitive biases” (p. 255), then it is important to know whether the bias
is real. The answer to this deceptively challenging question has
eluded researchers, paving the way for a new generation of researchers to question the very existence of a bias that psychologists
have been studying for more than 70 years (e.g., Harris & Hahn,
2011; Krizan & Windschitl, 2007; Moore & Healy, 2008;
Vosgerau, 2010).
Although no investigation can definitively overcome all the
challenges researchers face in trying to ensure that participants’
responses reflect their true beliefs, we believe that our research
presents the best answer to date to the question of whether optimistic biases persist among those who truly believe their predictions. The fact that optimistic forecasts persisted among those who
(a) were paid $50 for an accurate prediction and (b) gave every
indication that they believed their predictions, strongly suggests
that optimism is real and not merely cheap talk. At the same time,
our investigation does not indicate that all optimistic responses are
truthful. Participants were slightly less optimistic when $50 was at
stake than when $5 was at stake (especially those who supported

Point spreads of predicted games were the same for superior-team
partisans (M ⫽ 4.39) and inferior-team partisans (M ⫽ 4.38), t(405) ⫽

were as inferior as superior-team partisans’ teams were superior.

We also analyzed these results using a different dependent measure
(whether the participant predicted the home team to win the game) while
controlling for team quality using a continuous measure (the point spread).
Specifically, we regressed predictions on (a) Partisan (visiting-team partisan ⫽ ⫺1, neutral ⫽ 0, and home-team partisan ⫽ 1), (b) Incentive, (c) the
Partisan ⫻ Incentive interaction, and (d) the Point Spread. Whether analyzing the entire sample or just the true believers, the effect of Partisan was
highly significant (ps ⬍ .001), indicating significant optimism. The Incentive main effect and the Partisan ⫻ Incentive interaction were nonsignificant in all analyses (ps ⬎ .25).

inferior teams), as were participants who met our strict definition
of a true believer. Thus, it seems likely that a small but arguably
nontrivial proportion of participants were willing to predict their
favorite teams even though they did not fully believe those predictions.
Of course, the fact that this proportion exists does not alter our
conclusion: Although some people may respond optimistically
even when they do not believe it, it is most important that optimism is rampant even among those who do. As with research on
social preferences (e.g., the ultimatum game; Cameron, 1999),
demonstrating this bias under high-stakes conditions should shift
the discussion from whether optimism is a real phenomenon to
when and why it emerges.
