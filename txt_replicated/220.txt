In French, the transcription of the same sound can be guided by both probabilistic graphotactic constraints (e.g.,
/et/ is more often transcribed ette after -v than after -f) and morphological constraints (e.g., /et/ is always
transcribed ette when used as a diminutive suffix). Three experiments showed that pseudo-word spellings of
8-to 11-year-old children and adults were influenced by both types of constraints. The influence of graphotactic
regularities persisted when reliance on morphological rules was possible, without any falling off as a function of
age. This suggests that rules are not abstracted, even after massive amounts of exposure to a rule-based material.
These results can be accounted for by a statistical model of implicit learning.

Implicit learning occurs when somebody acquires
new information without intending to do so. It is
conceived as a fundamental process involved in
domains as diverse as knowledge about the physical
world, acquisition of social skills, first- and secondlanguage learning, and reading and writing. However, implicit learning has mainly been investigated
in laboratory settings through a wide variety of experimental situations involving complex and arbitrary stimulus domains (e.g., artificial grammar
learning, sequence learning, dynamic system control,
acquisition of invariant characteristics; for reviews,
see Berry & Dienes, 1993; Cleeremans, Destrebecqz,
& Boyer, 1998; Reber, 1993). Only recently, a few researchers have addressed connections between implicit learning experiments in the laboratory and in
real-life contexts, such as the acquisition of musical
structures (e.g., Tillmann, Bharucha, & Bigand, 2000),
first and second languages (e.g., Gomez & Gerken,
2000; Michas & Berry, 1994), and written language
(e.g., Pacton, Perruchet, Fayol, & Cleeremans, 2001).
For instance, Pacton et al. (2001) showed that

implicit learning experiments allows a better understanding of the nature of children’s orthographic
knowledge.
In this article, we take into account results issued
from the implicit learning literature to plan experiments designed to assess whether children rely on
untaught morphological rules. We begin by reviewing how the issue of rule abstraction has been dealt
within laboratory studies on implicit learning. Then,
we review the few studies on written language acquisition that address this issue. Finally, we discuss
the characteristics of French orthography that are
exploited in our experiments.

The Abstraction Issue in the Implicit Learning of
Artificial Grammars
Most studies designed to address the issue of rule
abstraction in implicit learning settings used Reber’s
(1967, 1993) artificial grammar learning (AGL) paradigm. In this paradigm, participants are asked to
memorize strings (unknown to them) generated
from a finite-state grammar that defines legal letters
and permissible transitions between them. After
training, participants are informed that this set of
stimuli is rule governed. They are then asked to
indicate whether a new set of strings obeys or
violates the rules. Participants typically get about
65% to 75% of these classifications correct. They are
generally unable to articulate rules used to generate
the material.

Children’s Implicit Learning

Reber (1967) has suggested that participants abstract the grammar rules during the study phase,
when they are exposed to sample of letter strings
generated from the grammar. During the test phase,
participants are assumed to use the acquired rulebased knowledge to judge the grammaticality of
new items. However, alternative explanations
have been subsequently proposed. In particular, it
has been suggested that participants could judge
grammaticality by making use of the relative frequency of particular fragments that were presented
in the study phase (e.g., Perruchet, 1994; Redington
& Chater, 1996). Because this account relies heavily
on the distributional and statistical aspects of the
materials, we hereafter refer to the statistical account
to refer to the alternative to rule-based account.
Another variant of the AGL studies does not seem
easily open to the statistical account yet. In this
variant, the surface form of the materials is changed
between training and test. For example, the training
string MXVVM and VXMTM might become HJKKH
and KJHLH, respectively. The new strings follow the
same underlying rules as the training string, but they
are instantiated with a novel set of stimuli (e.g.,
other letters, sequences of tones). In these transfer
situations, participants continue to perform at
above-chance levels. However, level of performance
with unfamiliar strings is lower than with familiar
strings (the so-called transfer-decrement phenomenon; e.g., Altmann, Dienes, & Goode, 1995; Dienes &
Altmann, 1997; Gomez, 1997; Redington & Chater,
2002; Shanks, Johnstone, & Staggs, 1997; Whittlesea
& Wright, 1997).
The possibility of transfer to new materials has
initially been seen as evidence for the claim that
participants in AGL studies acquire rule-based
knowledge during the training phase (Knowlton &
Squire, 1996; Reber, 1993). According to these studies, transfer to new materials rules out the theories of
AGL in which participants acquire knowledge of
whole instances, or fragments of the training materials, because these approaches would represent the
input in terms of its surface form.
However, even here, these results could be explained in terms of statistical learning. To do so, one
has to reconsider the opposition between rule-based
and statistical learning interpretations. In traditional
conceptions, the notion of rule involves surfaceindependent features, and the notion of statistical
mechanisms involves surface-dependent features.
However, as claimed by Redington and Chater
(2002), ‘‘surface-independence and rule-based
knowledge are orthogonal concepts’’ (p. 124). In
particular, statistical processes can apply to features

325

that are abstracted away from their sensory content.
Now, statistical principles acting on simple abstract
or relational primitives, such as those that can be
provided by low-level perceptual processes, can account for the available data evidencing transfer
(Perruchet & Vinter, 2002a, 2002b). In favor of this
account there is more empirical evidence that the
presence of simple repetitions or alternations in the
study strings is necessary to obtain transfer effects
(e.g., Gomez, Gerken, & Schvaneveldt, 2000; Tunney
& Altmann, 1999). Thus, transfer could occur because some perceptually salient features used for
statistical analyses are sufficiently abstract to be directly relevant to new materials and not because an
unconscious processor abstracts deep underlying
rules from a set of items of which only the surface
features would be initially encoded.
Although both rule-based and distributional
approaches can account for transfer effects, the
transfer-decrement phenomenon is problematic for
rule-based approaches because the use of genuine
rule-based knowledge is supposed to be similar for
familiar and unfamiliar items (e.g., Anderson, 1993;
Manza & Reber, 1997; Smith, Langston, & Nisbett,
1992; Whittlesea & Dorken, 1997). For instance,
Manza and Reber (1997), two advocates of rulebased knowledge, acknowledge that ‘‘a system that
represented knowledge in [this] pure abstract form
would result in transfer judgment accuracy being
equal to control judgment accuracy which, of course,
was not what we typically found’’ (p. 102). According to Manza and Reber, the transfer decrement
would correspond to a point in training at which the
rule-abstraction process is not yet fully completed.
This interpretation works well in lab studies in
which training is necessarily restricted.
However, the results reported by Pacton et al.
(2001) suggest that the transfer-decrement in lab
studies cannot be explained by insufficient practice
preventing the full development of abstract rulebased knowledge. They explored whether and to
what extent transfer to novel forms occurs in the
context of an out-of-the-lab learning situation that
extended over years. They investigated whether
children learn an untaught rule specifying that in
French, consonants can only be doubled in medial
position. Children were presented with pairs of
pseudo-words such that one pseudo-word in each
pair included a double consonant in legal position
whereas the other included a double consonant in
illegal position. Children were asked to select the
invented word in each pair that looked most like a
French word. As early as first grade, children judged
nullor (a pseudo-word with a doublet in a legitimate,

326

Pacton, Fayol, and Perruchet

word-medial position) as more word-like than nnulor
(with a doublet in a prohibited word-initial position).
This effect further transferred to consonants that do
not allow doubling in French. For example, although
k and x are never doubled in the language, children
found that pseudo-words such as koxxir were more
word-like than pseudo-words such as kkoxir. However, the effect for these letters remained substantially lower than for frequently doubled letters, and
the magnitude of this transfer-decrement remained
unchanged from Grades 1 to 6. Such a pattern of
results, also observed with a completion task, indicated that even after as long as 5 years of exposure to
print, children’s orthographic knowledge did not
correspond to a general rule such as ‘‘consonants can
only be doubled in medial position in French.’’
The question is now whether this conclusion generalizes to morphological rules, which involve semantic features.
Do Children Use Morphology in Their Spellings?
Morphemes designate linguistic units that have a
meaning or a syntactic function and that cannot be
subdivided in this way. For example, the word undesirable comprises three morphemes: the stem to
desire, the prefix un, and the suffix able. In many
written languages, knowledge of the relationships
between morphemes and script often helps in
choosing a particular spelling pattern when there are
two or more plausible spelling forms for the same
sound. For example, the English two-morpheme
word helped is formed by the stem help followed by
the inflectional morpheme -ed. Knowing that the final [t] of helped is a morpheme marking the past tense
leads to spell [t] -ed rather than -t. In a longitudinal
study, Nunes, Bryant, and Bindman (1997a) showed
that children initially spelled past regular verbs
phonetically (e.g., stept for stepped; see also Beers
& Beers, 1992; Treiman, 1993), then used the written
form -ed even for grammatically inappropriate words
(e.g., sofed for soft), then used -ed for all verbs (e.g.,
keped for kept), and, finally, used -ed only for regular
verbs (see Totereau, Barrouillet, & Fayol, 1998, for a
similar sequence concerning the acquisition of the
nominal and verbal plurals in written French).
However, it is difficult to determine whether the
evolution from spellings that are massively alphabetic (e.g., stept) to spellings that take morphology
into account (e.g., stepped) reflects children’s growing
morphological knowledge or, simply, rote learning of
specific word spelling over time. To disentangle between these alternatives, Bryant, Nunes, and Snaith
(2000; see also Nunes, Bryant, & Bindman, 1997b)

assessed children’s use of morphology with pseudoword spelling tasks. They investigated whether 8- to
11-year-old children learned an untaught rule of
spelling according to which English verbs whose
stems sound the same in the present and past forms
are given the -ed spelling (e.g., cleared, peeled) whereas
verbs whose stems sound different in the present
and past have phonetically spelled endings (e.g.,
heard, slept). Children were asked to spell regular
past pseudo-verbs, whose stems sound the same in
the present and past (e.g., /krel/ – /kreld/), and irregular past pseudo-verbs, whose stems sound different in the present and past (e.g., [/prel/ – /prold/])
that were embedded in sentences such as ‘‘My
friend always prells at bedtime. We usually prell in
the morning, but last week we /prold/ in the afternoon.’’ In the two studies, children spelled regular
past pseudo-verbs with an -ed ending more often
than they did the irregular verbs and, conversely,
spelled the endings of the irregular past pseudoverbs phonetically more often than they did the
regular verbs. Nunes et al. (1997b) further assessed
whether children came to master the use of morphological spelling patterns through reliance on a
rule or through analogies to real words by using irregular pseudo-verbs whose present and past tense
were either analogous or nonanalogous to those of
any real irregular verbs. The pattern held for nonanalogous pseudo-verbs but the performances were
lower than with analogous pseudo-verbsFa result
similar to Pacton et al. (2001) with regard to children’s knowledge about double letters and to the
transfer-decrement observed in AGL studies.
Even more recently, Kemp and Bryant (2003) explored whether children and adults rely on the
morphological spelling rule that regular plural endings in English must be spelled as -s whether they are
pronounced with a final /s/ (e.g., cats) or a final /z/
(e.g., dogs), even though nonplural /z/ endings can
be spelled -z, -zz, -ze, or -se. Because the plural form
of nouns ending in a consonant is always spelled
with -s, words such as pads could be correctly spelled
because children have learned that bs and ds are legal
endings in English whereas bz and dz are not (Cassar
& Treiman, 1997; Pacton et al., 2001) rather than because they use the plural morphological rule. However, reliance on graphotactic regularities, rather
than on the plural morphological rule, does not
work when the sound /z/ is preceded by a long
vowel because in this case /z/ can be spelled with
-s (plurals) or -ze or -se (nonplurals). Thus, reliance
on the plural morphological rule allows people to
spell all plural nouns correctly, but reliance on
graphotactic regularities leads to correct spellings for

Children’s Implicit Learning

nouns whose final /z/ is preceded by a consonant
but not for nouns whose final /z/ is preceded by a
long vowel. Kemp and Bryant reported that children
in Grades 1 to 3 were far more likely to use the
correct-s for a plural word when the /z/ ending was
immediately preceded by a consonant (e.g., fibs) than
when it was preceded by a long vowel (e.g., fleas).
Similar results were obtained with a task involving
pseudo-words with children and adults, indicating
that the pattern observed with words could not be
attributed to differences in the rote learning of
spellings. Kemp and Bryant concluded that children
‘‘rely on their sensitivity to the frequency with which
certain letters co-occur, rather than on their knowledge of a morphology-based rule, when spelling
plural and non-plural words and pseudowords’’
(p. 72).
The Present Study
French is a good candidate to sort out rule-based
and statistical interpretations of implicit learning.
The transcription of the same sound can be constrained by both graphotactic regularities (i.e., the
probability of succession of the graphemes; Jaffré &
Fayol, 1997) that are probabilistic and morphological
regularities that can be described with an (untaught)
abstract rule. This allowed us to explore the combined influence of two types of regularities that
are usually independently explored. Investigating
whether the graphotactic regularities continue to
influence spellers’ performances when reliance on a
morphological rule is possible constitutes a privileged way to explore whether rules are abstracted
after massive amounts of exposure to rule-based
material.
In French, the phoneme /o/ can be spelled as o
(e.g., piano), au (e.g., tuyau, hose), eau (e.g., manteau,
coat), ot (e.g., escargot, snail), aut (e.g., défaut, default),
among other spellings. Similarly, the sound /et/ can
be spelled ète (e.g., planète, planet), aite (e.g., défaite,
defeat), ette (e.g., assiette, plate), or ête (e.g., conquête,
conquest). The distribution of the transcriptions of
/o/ and /et/ varies as a function of the preceding
consonants (Brulex: Content, Mousty, & Radeau,
1990). For example, /et/ is rarely spelled ette after -b
and -t but is frequently after -l. Those graphotactic
regularities are probabilistic and idiosyncratic insofar as there is no single high-level rule that could
provide a concise definition for which letters can
precede a given transcription of /et/ or /o/. On the
other hand, /o/ is always transcribed eau and /et/ is
always transcribed ette when they correspond to diminutive suffixes (Catach, 1986).1 For instance,

327

éléphanteau (baby elephant) and renardeau (fox cub) are
two-morpheme words based on the stems éléphant
(elephant) and renard (fox) followed by the masculine
diminutive suffix -eau. Likewise, vachette (young cow)
and fillette (little girl) are two-morpheme words
based on the stems vache (cow) and fille (girl) followed
by the feminine diminutive suffix -ette. These simple
and productive rules, which are relevant to a large
sample of words, are untaught.
To investigate the influence of the graphotactic
and morphological regularities, we compared the
spelling of the same pseudo-words in two conditions: one involving only graphotactic constraints (G
condition) and the other involving morphological
and graphotactic constraints (GM condition). In the
G condition, children were asked to spell pseudowords such as /sorivet/ and /soritet/, which only
differed by the consonants that preceded /et/. We
hypothesized that if children were sensitive to
graphotactic regularities, they should use ette more
often for /sorivet/ than for /soritet/ because ette is
frequent after /v/ but rare after /t/. In the GM
condition, children were asked to spell the same
pseudo-words embedded within sentences such as
‘‘a little /soriv/ is a /sorivet/’’ or ‘‘a little /sorit/ is a
/soritet/.’’ Our hypothesis was that if the derivational morphology does influence children’s spellings, ette should be used more often in the GM
condition than in the G condition.
A rule-based model of implicit learning appears
especially relevant to account for the acquisition of
the morphological rules. Such a model predicts that
rule-abstraction processes are elicited when people
are faced with rule-governed material. However, this
model does not exclude the possibility that people
learn statistical regularities when these regularities
cannot be described by a rule (e.g., Manza & Reber,
1997). On the other hand, a statistical model of implicit learning is especially relevant to account for an
increasing sensitivity to graphotactic regularities.
However, such a model is able to account for a sensitivity to morphological regularities because statistical analyses do not only operate on low-level,
surface features (e.g., Perruchet & Vinter, 2002a,
2002b; Redington & Chater, 2002). Thus, when words
such as a ‘‘fillette’’ (a little girl) or a ‘‘maisonnette’’
(a little house) are encountered, the feature of diminutiveness may become associated with the feature ‘‘ends in ette,’’ and this association can be
strengthened through repetitions as with any other
association.
Although children’s increasing sensitivity to graphotactic and morphological regularities can be
explained within a rule-based and within a statistical

328

Pacton, Fayol, and Perruchet

model of implicit learning, the two models lead to
diverging predictions in our experimental situation.
The crucial point concerns the impact of the
graphotactic constraints in the GM condition. According to a rule-based account, people are initially
sensitive to the idiosyncratic properties of the material, and then rule knowledge evolves from this
sensitivity (Manza & Reber, 1997). Because of a
gradual abstraction of the morphological rules, the
impact of the graphotactic constraints in the GM
condition should progressively decrease. On the
other hand, according to a statistical account, children would become increasingly sensitive to both
graphotactic and morphological regularities. However, children are not assumed to abstract the rules
implicitly even in the morphological domain in
which such extraction is possible. Therefore, morphological constraints should not evolve as the
all-or-none effect that is typical of rule-directed
phenomena.
To sum, a rule-based account predicts an impact
of the graphotactic constraints in the G condition but
not in the GM condition after an extensive exposure
to written language. A statistical account predicts an
impact of the graphotactic constraints in both the G
and the GM conditions even after prolonged exposure to print.
Study 1
Method
Participants. Participants included 40 (18 females,
22 males) second-grade children (M age 5 8 years 3
months, SD 5 3.4 months), 40 (20 females, 20 males)
third-grade children (M age 5 9 years 3 months,
SD 5 4.6 months), and 40 (23 females, 17 males) fifth-

grade children (M age 5 11 years 1 month, SD 5 4.4
months). Children were recruited from two French
primary schools located in an area of average socioeconomic status in Dijon. The 120 children met the
following criteria: (a) parental permission, (b) French
as native language, and (c) no language problems
according to their teachers. In this study and all other
experiments reported here, the majority of the participants were white.
Stimuli. To construct the pseudo-words, we calculated the distributions of the written forms eau and
ette in the final position of words as a function of the
preceding consonant using a French computerized
database Brulex (Content et al., 1990). Table 1 shows
the stimuli used in Study 1.
Six pairs of pseudo-words were elaborated to test
the impact of graphotactic and morphological constraints on the transcription of /o/. The two pseudowords of each pair differed only with regard to their
final consonants. One pseudo-word ended with one
of the three consonants /r/, /t/, and /v/ after which
/o/ is frequently transcribed eau in French (e.g.,
/klar/ or /vitar/). The other pseudo-word ended
with one of the three consonants /k/, /f/, and /g/
after which /o/ is never transcribed eau in French
(e.g., /klaf/ or /vitaf/). A diminutive corresponding
to each of these 12 pseudo-words was elaborated by
adding /o/ after the final consonant of those pseudo-words. For example, the diminutive of /vitaro/
was composed of the stem /vitar/ followed by the
diminutive suffix /o/. Each of the six final endings
/ko/, /fo/, /go/, /ro/, /to/, and /vo/ occurred at
the end of one bisyllabic consonant-consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel (CCVCV) pseudo-word (e.g.,
/klaro/ or/ klafo/) and at the end of one trisyllabic
CVCVC pseudo-word (e.g., /vitaro/ or /vitafo/).

Note. Presented here are pseudo-words composed of a stem without diminutive suffix (e.g., /brev/) and their related pseudo-words
composed of a stem followed by a diminutive suffix (e.g., /brevo/). The cumulated frequencies (per million) of words in which the sounds
/o/ and /et/ of the /consonant 1o/ and /consonant 1et/ endings are transcribed respectively eau and ette are indicated in parentheses.

Children’s Implicit Learning

Hereafter, pseudo-words in which /o/ followed a
consonant after which /o/ is frequently transcribed
eau in French are labeled EAU frequent. Those in
which /o/ followed a consonant after which /o/
is never transcribed eau in French are labeled
EAU never.
Six pairs of pseudo-words were elaborated to test
the impact of graphotactic and morphological constraints on the transcription of /et/. The two pseudowords of each pair differed only with regard to their
final consonants. One pseudo-word
ended with one
R
of the three consonants / /, /l/, and /v/ after
which ette is frequent in French (e.g., /trav/ or
/soriv/). The other pseudo-word ended with one of
the three consonants /b/, /f/, and /t/ after which
ette is infrequent in French (e.g., /trat/ or/ sorit/). A
diminutive corresponding to each of these 12 pseudo-words was elaborated by adding /et/ after the
final consonant of those pseudo-words. For example,
the diminutive /sorivet/ was composed from the
stem /soriv/ followed by the suffix
R /et/. Each of the
six final endings /bet/, /fet/, / et/, /let/, /tet/,
and /vet/ occurred at the end of one bisyllabic
CCVCVC pseudo-word (e.g., /travet/ or /tratet/)
and at the end of one trisyllabic CVCVCV pseudoword (e.g., /sorivet/ or /soritet/). Hereafter, pseudo-words in which /et/ followed a consonant after
which /et/ is frequently transcribed ette in French
are labeled ETTE frequent. Those in which /et/ followed a consonant after which /et/ is rarely transcribed ette in French are labeled ETTE rare.
Two lists were made. The first list included the 12
pseudo-words ending with /o/ preceded by the
masculine indefinite article un (e.g., un /vitaro/) and
the 12 pseudo-words ending with /et/ preceded by
the feminine indefinite article une (e.g., une /sorivet/)
put in a random order. In the second list, each of the
24 pseudo-words of the first list was embedded
within a sentence such as ‘‘un petit /vitar/ est un
/vitaro/’’ (‘‘a little /vitar/ is a /vitaro/’’) or ‘‘une
petite /soriv/ est une /sorivet/’’ (‘‘a little /soriv/ is
a /sorivet/’’), which provided information about the
morphological structure of the pseudo-word (i.e., a
stem followed by the diminutive suffix /o/ or /et/).
The 24 items of both lists were audiotaped using a
tape recorder.
Procedure. The experiment included two sessions
separated by a 1-week interval. Children were told
that the experimenter had made up new words that
no one had ever seen or heard and that their task
consisted in writing these ‘‘new words.’’ In the two
conditions (G condition and GM condition), children
had to spell the pseudo-word preceded by the indefinite article un or une, but although the first list

329

was called out in the G condition, the second list was
provided in the GM condition. For example, participants were asked to write ‘‘a /vitaro/’’ in the two
conditions but heard ‘‘a /vitaro/’’ in the G condition
and ‘‘a little /vitar/ is a /vitaro/’’ in the GM condition. For each grade level, half of the participants
undertook the G condition in the first session and the
GM condition in the second session (G – GM groups).
The other half performed the experiment in the reverse order, that is, the GM condition in the first
session and the G condition in the second session
(GM – G groups).
Note that the GM condition after the G condition
seems more appropriate than the G condition after
the GM condition to assess the influence of morphological information on children’s spelling. Indeed, the question concerns the potential impact of
providing participants with morphological information (which is the case for the G – GM group)
rather than depriving them of this information
(which is the case in the GM – G group). However, a
potential problem with the G then GM order is that
children’s spelling could be influenced by graphotactic constraints in the GM condition because they
could try to spell the pseudo-words as they had
written them in the previous G condition, whereas
this effect would not be observed if the GM condition
has been conducted first. Although asking some
children to perform the sole GM condition would
have been enough, the children of the GM – G group
performed the G condition after the GM condition so
that the order of the G and GM conditions was
completely counterbalanced in Study 1.
Results
Because the material has been elaborated to assess
the impact of the graphotactic and morphological
constraints on the use of eau (to transcribe /o/) and
ette (to transcribe /et/), we focused on children’s use
of those spellings. However, it is interesting to note
that as early as second grade, /o/ and /et/ were
transcribed with a wide range of written forms. For
example, 35 second-grade children transcribed /o/
in at least three different ways and 5 second-grade
children used only two different ways. Phonologically incorrect transcriptions of [consonant1/o/]
and [consonant1/et/] endings (e.g., vitavo or vitaveau for /vitafo/) as well as phonologically plausible
spellings of /fo/ and /fet/ endings in which /f/ was
spelled ph instead of f were left out. This excludes
3.0% of the spelling of pseudo-words ending in /o/
and 4.1% of the spelling of pseudo-words ending
in /et/.

We first report the results for the pseudo-words
ending in /o/, then those for the pseudo-words ending in /et/. For each type of pseudo-words, analyses
of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to determine
when and how the graphotactic and morphological
constraints influenced children’s spelling, and how
the integration of these two constraints evolves
across grades. The proportion of /o/ transcribed eau
and the proportion of /et/ transcribed ette were
separately submitted to a 3 (grade: second, third,
and fifth)  2 (order: G – GM vs. GM – G)  2 (morphological constraints: G condition vs. GM condition)  2 (graphotactic constraints: EAU never vs.
EAU frequent; ETTE rare vs. ETTE frequent) ANOVA with repeated measures on the last two variables
for analyses taking participants as a random variable
(i.e., F1). For analyses on items (i.e., F2), the proportion of eau and the proportion of ette were separately submitted to a 2 (graphotactic constraints)  2
(morphological constraints)  3 (grade)  2 (order)
ANOVA with repeated measures on the last two
variables. Table 2 gives the proportion of /o/ transcribed eau and the proportion of /et/ transcribed
ette as a function of graphotactic constraints, morphological constraints, and grades for the G – GM
group and GM – G group.
Pseudo-words ending in /o/. The main effect of
grade was marginally significant by participants,
F1(2, 114) 5 2.8, p 5 .057, and was significant by
items, F2(2, 20) 5 16.6, po.001. Planned comparisons
indicated that eau was more often used in fifth grade
than in second and third grades, F1(1, 114) 5 5.8,
p 5 0.2; F2(1, 10) 5 19.9, p 5 .001. There was a main
effect of the graphotactic constraints, with EAU frequent pseudo-words more often spelled with eau
than EAU never pseudo-words (32.8% vs. 15.4%),
F1(1, 114) 5 89.0, po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 36.1, po.001.
The main effect of morphological constraints was
also significant, revealing a greater use of eau in the
GM condition than in the G condition, F1(1,
114) 5 17.6, po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 67.9, po.001.
The morphological constraints by grade interaction, F1(2, 114) 5 8.4, po.001; F2(2, 20) 5 44, po.001,
reflected that more use of eau in the GM condition
than in the G condition increased with grades (averaged on the order: 0.6% in second grade, 3.8% in
third grade, and 16.3% in fifth grade). The second
interaction resulted from the fact that eau was more
frequently used in the GM condition than in the
G condition in the two groups, but the difference
between the G and GM conditions was more pronounced for the G – GM group (29.7% vs. 19.5%),
F1(1, 57) 5 14.3, po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 58.4, po.001,
than for the GM – G group (25.5% vs. 21.9%),

examined the morphological constraints effect at
each grade level separately for the G – GM and GM –
G groups. Indeed, although the order of the G and
GM conditions was counterbalanced in this study,
the main interest with regard to the use of morphological information concerned the performance of
the G – GM group. For the G – GM group, significant
effects of the derivational morphology were observed in third grade (15.8%), F1(1, 19) 5 5.6, p 5 .03;
F2(1, 10) 5 7.8, p 5 .01, and in fifth grade (123.3%),

grade (18.8%), F1(1, 19) 5 4.2, p 5 .05; F2(1, 10) 5 16.9,
p 5 .002.
We now address the question of the integration of
the graphotactic and morphological constraints,
which is central to our study because it is on this
aspect that ruled-based and statistical accounts of
implicit learning lead to diverging predictions. Neither the Graphotactic Constraints  Morphological
Constraints interaction nor the Graphotactic Constraints  Morphological Constraints  Grade interaction were significant, Fso1. This means that the
impact of the graphotactic constraints did not differ
significantly according to whether pseudo-words
were spelled in the G condition or in the GM condition and that this effect was stable across grades.
ANOVAs conducted for the sole GM condition confirmed that the use of eau varied according to
graphotactic regularities in this condition for the G –
GM group, F1(1, 57) 5 37.2, po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 15.5,
p 5 .003, and for the GM – G group, F1(1, 57) 5 45.7,
po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 32.8, po.001, in a stable way
across grades (no Grade  Graphotactic Constraints
interaction for the two groups, Fso1).
Pseudo-words ending in /et/. There was a main effect of grade, F1(2, 114) 5 11.8, po.001; F2(2,
20) 5 52.3, po.001, with more ette in fifth grade
than in second and third grades, F1(1, 114) 5 22.5,
po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 87.3, po.001, Fso1. There was a
main effect of the graphotactic constraints, with
ETTE frequent pseudo-words more often spelled
with ette than were ETTE rare pseudo-words (77.4%
vs. 49.1%), F1(1, 114) 5 145.2, po.001; F2(1,
10) 5 39.1, po.001. Children’s spellings were also
influenced by morphological constraints, with /et/
more often spelled ette in the GM condition than in
the G condition (68.0% vs. 58.5%), F1(1, 114) 5 32.3,
po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 30.3, po.001. This effect was
significant in the three grades (7.9% in second grade,
8.0% in third grade, and 9.0% in fifth grade, all
Fs45.5, pso.04).
The Order  Graphotactic Constraints  Morphological Constraints interaction was significant by
participants only, F1(1, 114) 5 4.8, p 5 .03; F2(1,
10) 5 3.3, p 5 .1. This interaction reflected the fact
that the magnitude of the graphotactic constraints
effect in the GM condition was higher for the G – GM
group (31.4%) than for the GM – G group (21.7%),
whereas the magnitude of the graphotactic constraints effect in the G condition did not differ between the G – GM group (29.8%) and the GM – G
group (30.6%). Beyond this difference, the important
result was the existence of a significant graphotactic
constraints effect in the GM condition for the G – GM
group, F1(1, 57) 5 37.2, po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 15.5,

331

p 5 .003, and for the GM – G group, F1(1, 57) 5 66.8,
po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 50, po.001. Furthermore, this
effect was stable across grades in the two groups (no
Grade  Graphotactic Constraints interactions in the
GM condition for the two groups, Fso1).
Discussion
From the third grade onward, eau was used more
often in the GM condition than in the G condition, at
least for the G – GM group. As early as second grade,
in the G – GM and GM – G groups, ette was used
more often in the GM condition than in the G condition. We reasoned that greater use of eau and ette in
the GM condition than in the G condition would
reveal the impact of morphology on children’s
spelling, and this is the result we obtained. However,
as the crucial comparison was between the writing of
the same pseudo-words in isolation and within a
sentence, one may argue that the difference observed
between the G and GM conditions reflects some influence of the sentence independent of the specific
information provided by the diminutive suffix. For
instance, the sentence emphasizes the possibility of
decomposing the pseudo-words into parts. This may
prompt children to isolate the suffix and to deal with
it as an individual chunk. This could modify its
spelling irrespective of whether the morphological
information about diminutiveness has been influential. This hypothesis was explored in Study 2. Study
2 showed that this alternative failed to account for
the higher use of eau and ette in the GM condition
than in the G condition in Study 1.
Children’s transcriptions of /o/ and /et/ further
varied according to their preceding consonants in
both the G and the GM conditions. This result extends previous studies in which the impact of the
graphotactic regularities was explored as a separate
issue (e.g., Cassar & Treiman, 1997; Nation, 1997;
Pacton, Fayol, & Perruchet, 1999; Treiman, 1993) by
showing that sensitivity to orthographic frequency
patterns still influences children’s spelling when
they can rely on a simple, morphology-based rule.
The size of the graphotactic constraints effect in the
GM condition was stable across grades in the two
groups. Thus, the existence of a graphotactic constraints effect in the GM condition for the G – GM
group could not be explained by children’s tendency
to spell the pseudo-words as they did in the former
G condition. Because a rule-governed behavior
should no longer be influenced by whether the material is more or less familiar (e.g., Anderson, 1993;
Manza & Reber, 1997; Whittlesea & Dorken, 1997),
the impact of the graphotactic constraints in the GM

332

condition indicates that children did not rely on
morphological rules such as ‘‘if /et/ corresponds to a
diminutive suffix, then /et/ is spelled ette’’ even after 5 years of exposure to print. It could nevertheless
be argued that the oldest group in Study 1 consisted
of fifth graders, and that 5 years of exposure to print
could be insufficient to pick up a general rule. The
aim of Study 3 was to assess whether the spelling of
pseudo-words by French adults was influenced by
graphotactic regularities when the context provided
them with clear cues for relying on morphological
rules specifying how to spell the diminutive suffixes
/o/ and /et/.
Study 2
In Study 1, eau and ette, the correct transcriptions of
/o/ and /et/ when they correspond to diminutive
suffixes, were more often used in the GM condition
than in the G condition. Because pseudo-words were
dictated in isolation in the G condition and embedded within a sentence triggering the individualization of the suffix in the GM condition, the departure
between the two conditions could result from this
difference rather than from the information provided
about diminutiveness by the suffix. Study 2 explores
whether such an alternative explanation can account
for the results that we interpreted as evidence for the
impact of morphology on children’s spelling in
Study 1. After a G condition similar to the one used
in Study 1, in which participants heard ‘‘a /vitaro/’’
or ‘‘a /sorivet/,’’ participants heard sentences such
as ‘‘a tall /vitar/ is a /vitaro/’’ or ‘‘a tall /soriv/ is a
/sorivet/.’’ Thus, in this situation, the stem was also
presented in isolation (/vitar /, /soriv/) and within
a pseudo-word (/vitaro/, /sorivet/) and the information provided by the sentence also concerned the
height. If the higher use of eau and ette in the GM
condition than in the G condition in Study 1 only
resulted from embedding pseudo-words within a
sentence triggering the individualization of /o/ and
/et/, the use of eau and ette should also increase from
the isolation condition to the sentence condition in
Study 2. By contrast, if the higher use of eau and ette
in the GM condition than in the G condition in Study
1 reflects the impact of the morphological information about diminutiveness on children’s spelling, eau
and ette should not be used differently in the isolation and sentence conditions in Study 2.
Method
Participants. We tested 20 (13 females, 7 males)
third-grade children (M age 5 9 years 1 month,
SD 5 3.9 months) and 20 (10 females, 10 males) fifth-

grade children (M age 5 10 years 9 months, SD 5 4.2
months). Children were recruited from a French
primary school located in an area of average socioeconomic status in Dijon. The 40 children met the
following criteria: (a) parental permission, (b) French
as native language, and (c) no language problems
according to their teachers.
Stimuli. The pseudo-words used in Study 1 were
used again in Study 2. The first list was identical to
the one used in Study 1, with the 12 pseudo-words
ending with /o/ preceded by the masculine indefinite article un (e.g., un /vitaro/) and the 12 pseudowords ending with /et/ preceded by the feminine
indefinite article une (e.g., une /kalalet/) put in a
random order. In the second list, each of the 24
pseudo-words was embedded within a sentence such
as ‘‘un grand /vitar/ est un /vitaro/’’ (‘‘a tall /vitar/
is a /vitaro/’’) or ‘‘une grande /soriv/ est une /sorivet/’’ (‘‘a tall /kalal/ is a /sorivet/’’). The 24 items
of both lists were audiotaped using a tape recorder.
Procedure. The experiment included two sessions
separated by a 1-week interval. Children were told
that the experimenter had made up new words that
no one had ever seen or heard before and that their
task consisted in writing these ‘‘new words.’’ Children had to spell the same pseudo-words preceded
by the indefinite article un or une in the two conditions but, whereas the first list was called out in the
first isolation condition, the second list was provided
in the sentence condition.
Results
Leaving out phonologically incorrect transcriptions of [consonant1/o/] and [consonant1/et/]
endings (e.g., vitavo /vitafo/) excludes 0.5% of the
spelling of pseudo-words ending in /o/ and 2.1% of
the spelling of pseudo-words ending in /et/. The
proportion of /o/ transcribed eau and the proportion
of /et/ transcribed ette were separately submitted to
a 2 (grade: third vs. fifth)  2 (graphotactic constraints: EAU never vs. EAU frequent; ETTE rare vs.
ETTE frequent)  2 (condition: isolation vs. sentence) ANOVA with repeated measures on the last
two variables for analyses taking participants as a
random factor (i.e., F1). For analyses on items (i.e.,
F2), the proportion of /o/ transcribed eau and the
proportion of /et/ transcribed ette were separately
submitted to a 2 (graphotactic constraints)  2 (condition)  2 (grade) ANOVA with repeated measures
on the last two variables. Table 3 gives the proportion
of /o/ transcribed eau and the proportion of /et/
transcribed ette according to graphotactic constraints
in the isolation and sentence conditions.

With regard to pseudo-words ending in /o/, as in
Study 1, /o/ was more often spelled eau for EAU
frequent pseudo-words (33.7%) than for EAU never
pseudo-words (12.0%), F1(1, 38) 5 55.4, po.001; F2(1,

proportion of eau did not differ significantly according to whether pseudo-words were written in
isolation (21.8%) or embedded within sentences
(23.8%), Fso1. Neither the grade level effect nor the
four interactions were significant, Fso1.
With regard to pseudo-words ending in /et/,
fifth-grade children used ette more often than did
third-grade children (78.1% vs. 49.7%), F1(1, 38) 5
6.6, p 5 .014; F2(1, 10) 5 31.6, po.001. As in Study 1,
/et/ was more often spelled ette for ETTE frequent
pseudo-words (78.1%) than for ETTE rare pseudowords (49.7%), F1(1, 19) 5 52.0, po.001; F2(1, 10) 5
49.5, po.001. However, contrary to Study 1, the proportion of ette did not differ significantly according
to whether pseudo-words were written in isolation
(64.5%) or embedded within sentences (63.3%), Fso1.
The four interactions were not significant, Fso1.
Discussion
Study 2 confirmed the influence of graphotactic
regularities on children’s transcription of /o/ and
/et/ found in Study 1. The major result of Study 2,
however, was that eau and ette were not used differently according to whether pseudo-words were
dictated in isolation or within sentences. This lack of
difference between the isolation and sentence con-

333

ditions in Study 2 shows that the increasing use of
eau and ette from the G condition to the GM condition in Study 1 could not be attributed to a byproduct of embedding pseudo-words within sentences but, on the contrary, did reflect the influence
of derivational morphology on children’s spelling.
Study 3
In Study 1, children’s spellings were influenced by
morphological information and by graphotactic
regularities when no morphological rule could be
applied (G condition) but also in conditions triggering the application of the morphological rule (GM
condition). The impact of the graphotactic constraints in the GM condition, which remained stable
across grades, indicated that children did not systematically rely on morphological rules such as ‘‘if
/et/ corresponds to a diminutive suffix, then /et/ is
spelled ette’’ after 5 years of exposure to print. Because 5 years of exposure to print may not be enough
to pick up the morphological rules exploited in the
present study, Study 3 explored whether graphotactic constraints still influenced adults’ spellings in the
GM condition.
Method
Participants. Participants were 60 (52 females, 8
males) students from a 1st-year psychology course
(M age 5 19 years 1 month, range 5 17 years 11
months to 23 years 6 months). All participants were
French native speakers.
Stimuli. The stimuli used in Study 3 were exactly
the same as those used in Study 1.
Procedure. The same procedure was used in
Studies 1 and 3, except that although the same participants practiced the G and GM conditions in Study
1, participants were assigned either to the G condition (30 participants) or to the GM condition (30
participants) in Study 3. In Study 1, a within-subject
design was used to ensure that the difference between the G and GM conditions reflected the influence of morphology on children’s spellings rather
than participant groups. A between-subject design
was used in Study 3, which was primarily aimed at
assessing whether there was still an impact of
graphotactic regularities in conditions triggering the
application of the morphological rule (GM condition) in an adult population.

ogy. An interesting characteristic of the French
written language is that graphotactic constraints
(that are probabilistic) and morphological constraints (that are describable by an abstract, general
rule) can be used to guide the transcription of the
same sound. This allowed us (a) to explore the joint
influence on children’s spelling of two types of information (morphology and graphotactic regularities) that are usually explored independently and (b)
to assess whether spelling was driven by rules or
statistical processes. If rules are actually involved,
graphotactic regularities should lose their influence
on spelling when this latter can be determined by
morphological rules.

Note. Standard deviations are in parentheses. G 5 only graphotactic constraints; GM 5 graphotactic and morpological constraints.

Sensitivity to Graphotactic Regularities
of graphotactic constraints, morphological constraints, and condition. There were main effects of
the morphological constraints, with greater use of
eau in the GM condition (47%) than in the G condition (33.7%), F1(1, 58) 5 6.1, p 5 .016; F2(1, 10) 5 17.0,
p 5 .002, and likewise more use of ette in the GM
condition (79.1%) than in the G condition (63.7%),
F1(1, 58) 5 6.9, p 5 .01; F2(1, 10) 5 20.1, p 5 .001.
There were also main effects of the graphotactic
regularities for pseudo-words ending with /o/
(56.7% vs. 23.9%), F1(1, 58) 5 114.4, po.001; F2(1,
10) 5 35.5, po.001, and for pseudo-words ending
with /et/ (82.2% vs. 60.5%), F1(1, 58) 5 114.4,
po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 35.5, po.001. As for elementary
school children, there was no interaction between the
morphological and graphotactic constraints for
pseudo-words ending in /o/, F1(1, 58) 5 0.1, p 5 .7;
F2(1, 10) 5 0.1, p 5 .7, and for pseudo-words ending
in /et/, F1(1, 58) 5 0.5, p 5 .5; F2(1, 10) 5 3.0, p 5 .11.
Analyses for the sole GM condition confirmed the
existence of significant graphotactic constraint effects in this condition, for pseudo-words ending in
/o/, F1(1, 29) 5 39.9, po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 21.3,
po.001, as well as for pseudo-words ending in /et/,
F1(1, 29) 5 21.9, po.001; F2(1, 10) 5 5.7, p 5 .04.
Thus, adults’ spellings were influenced by
graphotactic constraints even in conditions triggering the application of the morphological rule, as
were the spellings of the elementary school children
in Study 1.
General Discussion
In the present study, a pseudo-word spelling task
was used to explore children’s (implicit) learning of
graphotactic regularities and derivational morphol-

As early as second grade, children used many
different written forms to transcribe /o/ and /et/.
We focused on the fact that children’s use of eau and
ette varied as a function of their preceding consonants. However, their use of spellings other than eau
and ette also varied as a function of the preceding
consonants. For example, in the G condition in Study
1, the fifth graders of the G – GM group spelled /o/
as aut more often after -f than after -r (7 vs. 2) and
spelled /et/ as ête more often after -t than after -ch
(18 vs. 1), which corresponds to the distribution in
Brulex (Tokens: 7,112 for faut vs. 153 for raut; 65,245
for tête vs. 0 for chête; Content et al., 1990). Thus, from
an early age, children did not rely on phonemes and
graphemes independently of the context (Pacton et
al., 1999). One possibility is that the size of the
sound-to-spelling correspondences on which children base their spellings is larger than the phonemegrapheme unit (e.g., Nation, 1997; Nation & Hulme,
1996). Another possibility is that children rely on
phonemes and graphemes but that the associations
are sensitive to context. Children could be sensitive
to graphotactic regularities, that is, to regularities
relative to the order of letters. For instance, eau is
frequently attached to -v but not to -f, independent of
any regularity at a phonological level. In favor of this
account, there is empirical evidence of statistical
learning of the order of visual shapes (e.g., Fiser &
Aslin, 2002). However, children could also be sensitive to the association between eau and certain
sounds (e.g., eau is more often associated with /v/
than with /f/). If this were the case, it would be more
appropriate to say that children are sensitive to
phonographotactic regularities. The choice between
these two accounts calls for further specifically
devised studies.

Children’s Implicit Learning

Children’s increasing sensitivity to the frequency
or position of different patterns of the written language to which they are exposed is a further example
of sensitivity to the distributional features of input,
which has been reported in humans of all ages. For
instance, after exposure to a synthesized speech
stream composed of multisyllabic nonsense words,
8-month-old infants distinguished word from nonword syllable sequences when the only cues to word
boundaries were in the distributional or statistical
properties of the input (Saffran, Newport, & Aslin,
1996; see Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, & Newport, 1999
for similar results with streams of tones). In AGL
studies, adult participants learned the frequency of
chunks of information, such as two- or three-letter
groupings (Perruchet & Pacteau, 1990) and their
position (Reber & Allen, 1978). Sensitivity to statistical regularities in the written language domain
further strengthens the idea that the development of
such sensitivity is subtended by general learning
mechanisms (Bates & Elman, 1996; Christiansen &
Curtin, 1999; Perruchet & Vinter, 1998; Redington &
Chater, 1998).
Sensitivity to Morphological Regularities
To assess the impact of derivational morphology
on children’s spelling, we compared children’s use
of eau and ette (the conventional transcriptions of
the diminutive suffixes /o/ and /et/) according to
whether the same pseudo-words were spelled in
isolation (e.g., ‘‘a /sorivet/,’’ G condition) or embedded within sentences, indicating that pseudo-words
were composed of a stem followed by a diminutive
suffix (e.g., ‘‘a little /soriv/ is a /sorivet/,’’ GM
condition). In Study 1, ette was used more often in
the GM condition than in the G condition as early as
second grade. The same effect was observed from
third grade onward for eau. Embedding the same
pseudo-words within sentences in which /o/ and
/et/ were not diminutive suffixes anymore did not
increase children’s use of eau and ette (Study 2), indicating that the higher use of eau and ette in the GM
condition than in the G condition in Study 1 was
linked to the morphological information provided by
the ‘‘a little’’ context.
The derivational morphology effect occurred earlier for pseudo-words ending in /et/ (second grade)
than for pseudo-words ending in /o/ (third grade)
probably because a larger proportion of words ending in ette are diminutives than are words ending in
eau. This is true in French in general but more specifically in children’s books. Children may be particularly sensitive to the morphological structure of

335

words ending with the diminutive morpheme ette
because words such as fille (girl) and fillette (little
girl) are frequent in their books. Beyond this difference and its potential roots, this study adds to the
growing body of evidence (e.g., Bryant et al., 2000;
Pacton, 2001; Treiman et al., 1994; Treiman & Cassar,
1996) that children use morphological information
much earlier than is postulated by traditional stage
models of spelling acquisition (e.g., Frith, 1985;
Henderson, 1985).
Integrating Graphotactic and Morphological Constraints
and the Abstraction Issue
The crucial comparison was between children’s
spellings of pseudo-words that can be spelled
through reliance on the same morphological rule
(e.g., ‘‘/et/ is transcribed ette when it corresponds to
a diminutive suffix’’) but that differ in terms of
graphotactic regularities (e.g., /et/ preceded by a
consonant after which /et/ is frequently or rarely
spelled ette). Our reasoning was that if spellers have
(implicitly) abstracted rules specifying how to transcribe /o/ and /et/ when they correspond to diminutive morphemes, the graphotactic constraints
effect, expected and observed in the G condition,
should no longer be observed in the GM condition.
Although participants took into account the morphological information, as testified by the higher use
of eau and ette in the GM condition than in the
G condition, their use of eau and ette varied as a
function of the graphotactic constraints in the GM
condition. This happened regardless of whether the
GM condition followed (G – GM groups) or preceded
(GM – G groups) the G condition. Furthermore, there
was no trend toward a reduction in the magnitude
of the graphotactic regularities impact in the GM
condition from the second to the fifth grades in
Study 1, and the impact of the graphotactic regularities was still observed among adult participants
in Study 3. This echoes Kemp and Bryant’s (2003)
study in which children and adults correctly used
-s for plural pseudo-words more often when the final
/z/ was preceded by a consonant than when it
was preceded by a long vowel, despite the possibility
of relying on a rule specifying that plural nouns are
spelled with -s.
These results are problematic for rule-based proponents of implicit learning (e.g., Manza & Reber,
1997). Indeed, according to them, performances on
implicit learning tasks vary according to the familiarity of the material used to assess participants’
learning because the test takes place at a point in
training when the rule-abstraction process is not yet

336

Pacton, Fayol, and Perruchet

fully completed. This account works well in lab
studies in which training is necessarily restricted.
However, it no longer applies in natural situations
involving a massive amount of practice.
The pervasive impact of the graphotactic constraints in the GM condition, even after massive exposure to print, can be accounted for by a statistical
perspective in which learning processes can apply to
features that are abstracted away from their sensory
content (Perruchet & Vinter, 2002a, 2002b; Redington
& Chater, 2002). According to this perspective, abstract features such as diminutiveness can become
associated with features such as ‘‘ends in ette.’’
Children’s learning of this association would lead
them to use ette more often when pseudo-words such
as /vitaret/ are embedded within sentences such as
‘‘a little /vitar/ is a /vitaret/.’’ Associations between
other features would also be established. In particular, as words with the final ette preceded by the
letter -v (or the sound /v/) are far more frequent
than words with the final ette preceded by the letter -f
(or the sound /f/), the association between -v and
ette (or between /v/ and ette) would be stronger than
the association between -f and ette (or between /f/
and ette). Therefore, ette would be less often used for
pseudo-words such as /vitafet/ than for pseudowords such as /vitavet/ in the G and GM conditions.
Thus, the graphotactic constraints effect persisted in
the GM condition because even though children
encountered more words ending with eau and ette in
which the final /o/ and /et/ stood for diminutive
suffixes, words in which ette followed the letter -v (or
the sound /v/) always outnumber words in which
ette followed the letter -f (or the sound /f/).
A second account of the results that does not rely
on abstract rule-based knowledge comes from the
consideration that pseudo-words are spelled by
analogy to real words. In this account, the effect of
graphotactic regularities is due to the fact that the
consonantal context is certainly a dimension relevant
for drawing an analogy. For instance, a pseudo-word
ending in /ret/ will preferentially evoke a word
ending in /ret/; likewise, a pseudo-word ending in
/fet/ will preferentially evoke a word ending in
/fet/. Because a word ending in /ret/ has more
chance of being spelled ette than a word ending in
/fet/, the same outcome will be observed for a
pseudo-word similar on this dimension. However,
an analogy could also rely on more abstract features,
such as the notion of diminutiveness, in the same
way as statistical analysis can take both surface and
abstract features as primitives. Because a diminutive
word is spelled ette, the same outcome will be observed for a pseudo-word sharing this feature.

Therefore, this interpretation also accounts for children’s sensitivity to morphological rules. Moreover,
the fact that the graphotactic constraint effect persists
in the GM condition finds a natural explanation.
Indeed, there is no a priori reason to assume that the
notion of diminutiveness systematically provides a
better cue for drawing an analogy than the phonological dimension. Thus, our findings may result
from the fact that analogies could be based on one or
the other of multiple dimensions, as a function of
various factors. The choice between this latter account and an interpretation based on the extraction
of statistical regularities calls for further specially
devised studies. This kind of alternative is common
to many domains. Without prejudging a conclusion
for the specific issue dealt with in this article, it is
worth noting that studies conducted in other domains have generally concluded that the analogy to
specific words cannot account for the whole pattern
of results (e.g., Bailey & Hahn, 2001; Perruchet, 1994).
A third interpretation of the persistence of the
graphotactic constraints effect in the diminutive
condition is that even though the morphological
units are /o/ and /et/, the association between /o/
and eau, on the one hand, and between /et/ and ette,
on the other hand, could be established at level other
than that of the morpheme. For example, when
words such as éléphanteau (baby elephant) are encountered in a context in which it is associated with
the feature of diminutiveness, an association could
be established between the diminutiveness and /to/
or teau rather than between the diminutiveness and
/o/ or eau. According to this account, participants
would use eau when they are told that a little /klat/
is a /klato/, but they would be less inclined to use
eau when they are told that a /klafo/ is a little /klaf/
because /fo/ does not sound like a diminutive (see
Kemp & Bryant, 2003, for a similar interpretation).
Note also one could argue that participants learn
rules that are specific and idiosyncratic rather than
general (e.g., /to/ is spelled teau when it is a diminutive suffix). Such an interpretation in terms of
rules that have limited scope, which would apply or
not as a function of the context or the familiarity with
the situation, would account for the graphotactic
effect observed in the GM condition. However, in so
doing, it loses what makes rules attractive, namely,
their propensity to apply in a large number of
situations irrespective of the participant’s familiarity
with these situations. If rules apply only in situations where simpler accounts work well, respect of
the Occam’s razor principle leads us to suggest
that an abstractionist, rule-based position should be
discarded.

Children’s Implicit Learning

Conclusion
In the present study, children’s spellings were
influenced by graphotactic regularities even in conditions triggering the application of a morphological
rule. Indeed, children’s and adults’ correct transcription of /o/ and /et/ varied as a function of
graphotactic regularities despite the possibility of
relying on simple rules such as ‘‘/et/ is transcribed
ette when it corresponds to a diminutive.’’ Furthermore, the magnitude of this effect persisted over
grade levels without any trend toward fading, as
well as with adults. When coupled with other studies in which children or adults did not rely on morphological rules to spell pseudo-words (Kemp &
Bryant, 2003; Nunes et al., 1997b) and words (Kemp
& Bryant, 2003; Pacton & Fayol, 2003), it appears
difficult to reconcile these data with the idea that
participants rely on increasingly abstract, rule-based
knowledge about the regularities contained in the
material over training. The interesting picture that
emerges from studies exploring whether children
acquire implicitly orthographic and morphological
rules is that similar trends are observed for aspects of
the written language that are semantically grounded,
such as inflectional morphology (Kemp & Bryant,
2003; Nunes et al., 1997b) and derivational morphology (the present study) and for aspects of the
written language that are not semantically or morphologically grounded (e.g., the legal position of
double letters; Pacton et al., 2001). The generality of
this finding needs to be confirmed using other aspects of the written language. Nevertheless, these
results are interesting because one could have hypothesized that spellers’ orthographic behavior
would be more likely to be rule directed for semantically grounded aspects of the language.
These results have significance for spelling acquisition. Many authors (e.g., Lennox & Siegel, 1994;
Snowling, 1994; Treiman & Cassar, 1997) have emphasized the need to develop theories of spelling
that do not follow a stage-like framework but that,
conversely, take into account the relationships between the different sources of information (phonological, morphological, and lexical) that influence
spelling. For this reason, it is crucial to study simultaneously the impact of different sources of information and their potential interactions. From this
perspective, an important result of the present study
is that sensitivity to graphotactic regularities, which
has already been well documented when explored for
itself (e.g., Cassar & Treiman, 1997; Pacton et al., 2001),
still influences the performances of spellers even when
they can rely on a simple, morphology-based rule.

The written forms eau and ette do not always correspond to diminutives in French. For instance, the words
rateau (rake) and crevette (shrimp) end, respectively, by eau
and ette but are monomorphemic words. There is one exception to the rule of formation of the diminutive /o/: in
the word chiot (pup); the diminutive suffix /o/ is not
transcribed eau but ot. However, the word chiot does not
end like the other words, that is, with a consonant sound
followed by /o/ but by a vowel sound followed by /o/.
